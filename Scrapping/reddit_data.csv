549,q1zcf0,s3k2p7s9m8b5,"In the over 12,9 Million Documents and Terabytes of Data detailing how Billionaires and Politicians have avoided Taxes, Bitcoin is not used a Single Time.",4522,298,"Pandora Papers:

Terabytes of data, 12.9 million documents, all detailing how billionaires and over 300 corrupt politicians have avoided taxes, and Bitcoin was not used a single time by them.

How can it be that exactly the politicians who claim that crypto would be the main accelerator of financial crime and tax evasion have used exclusively the broken old financial system to do that which they blame crypto on supporting.

With Bitcoin every single transaction would be transparent on the blockchain, everyone could see where all the money is going. Wondering why they are so against it? The reason seems more obvious than ever.

Pandora papers showed that people are using loopholes in tax laws to hide their wealth in tax havens to hide their wealth or ill gotten gains. They are not using cryptocurrency to do that, there are plenty of loopholes in tax laws for doing it legally.

The rich are holding properties and investments under a network of offshore companies that are set up in other countries, or ""offshore"".

These offshore countries or territories are where:

\- it's easy to set up companies

\- there are laws that make it difficult to identify owners of companies

\- there is low or no corporation tax.

The best part of it is that using tax havens to dodge taxes is not illegal. Loopholes in the law allow people to legally avoid paying some taxes by  moving their money or setting up companies in tax havens, but it is  often seen as unethical.

Its estimated that from $5.6 trillion to $32 trillion is hidden in tax havens, according to the ICIJ.  The IMF has said the use of tax havens costs governments worldwide up to $600bn in lost taxes each year.

To hide money all you need to do set up a shell company in one of the countries or  jurisdictions with high levels of secrecy. This is a company that exists  in name only, with no staff or office.  It costs money though. Specialist firms are paid to set up and run shell  companies on your behalf. These firms can provide an address and names  of paid directors, therefore leaving no trail of who is ultimately  behind the business.

When such a huge amount of money is hidden in offshore havens, the rich still blames cryptocurrency as the culprit for money laundering. This is classic gaslighting. They are projecting and blaming the most vulnerable group, what they do themselves.

This legal way of tax dodging will never end because the people that could end the secrecy offshore are themselves benefiting from it. So there's no incentive for them to end it.

Its time more people speak up against this and move more towards cryptocurrency where all data is independently verifiable.",2021-10-05 15:55:05

353,q2qhyo,olli_ita,Yesterday i got a call from my Bank,917,358,"My bank‚Äôs Director called me yesterday (never talked or met him before).
He told me they were doing some security checks and some ‚Äúanomalies‚Äùpopped up on my account. They noticed I was regularly moving my monthly income into exchanges and the director wanted to warn me about the risks and volatility or cryptos which btw i‚Äôm fully aware of.
He wanted to make sure that I wasn‚Äôt investing debt in crypto which of course i‚Äôm not. I only invest my hard earned money and what I‚Äôm willing to lose. Im totally debt free and i owe nothing to my bank.
So I asked him what he knew about cryptocurrencies in general. He said : ‚ÄúI heard Elon mask bought a lot of it‚Äù.

I‚Äôm from a small city in Italy (so please apologize my english) and I was not expecting to the Director of my bank to know much about crypto but also not that little.
He kindly asked me not to bring back the money all at once and I simply told him that i have no intention to do so and that i‚Äôm crypto for the long run and not for speculation. I also told him that I was aware of the capital gain tax in case of withdrawals.
He asked some fairly personal financial questions and even though we didn‚Äôt speak about numbers I knew he knew because he told me that he could see my money transfers to exchanges which I didn‚Äôt really like. On the other hand, i had the opportunity to ask him some questions and discovered that I am the only one in that particular bank that is involved with cryptocurrencies

I‚Äôm sharing this story with you because I found very interesting that my bank noticed me. I am your average 28 yo guy with an average job and an average salary.
I think in the future banks and governments will do their best to make it harder for the average Joe to get involved in crypto.",2021-10-06 18:33:17

Don't believe me? Here's the challenge...

**I've deposited 10,000 sats into a wallet. You get to guess the seed phrase.**

To make it even easier, **I'm going to give you ALL of the words.**

That's right, I'm literally going to give you ALL of the seed words, in random order, for your guessing pleasure.

**Here they are:**

    chalk mimic crane marriage oxygen hood million clerk demand effort grid afford floor force december immense damp toss assume present retire cream clinic gown

All 24 of them right there.

But there's not actually BTC in there right? **WRONG**.

Go ahead and check the balance [HERE](https://www.blockonomics.co/#/search?q=zpub6s87mnPqX9jT5bWvKFz6ZLCrhQsPh275BXx45a9kRuXUYbcxhLYZCpzyP2TpuEWte9mDYMprJv6QwNtCd7D64PAQMj4kSdu1WSZRQL3exyk)

You've even got the zpub there to see all addresses for the wallet.

I'm not shitting you. The words are there. The free BTC is there.

Just go and get it right? RIGHT?

\--------------------------------------------------

**Now, if you want to find out why you're going to fail miserably at this, keep reading...**

Why is it near (and I mean neeeaaarrr) impossible for someone to be randomly assigned your words, or to be guessed by somebody else?

To find out, let's start with a worst case scenario, a head start if you will: **Somebody knows all of your 24 words, but not the exact order of them.**

You might think that's an INSANE advantage right? Let's see...

To find out how many ways you can order 24 words, we can use a factorial. A factorial is simply multiplying a number by all of the numbers below it, denoted by a ""!"" after the number.

4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24

So what's the factorial of 24?...

24! = 24 x 23 x 22 x 21... = **~620,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.**

That is **620 sextillion unique ways to order 24 words.**

To put that into perspective, the average high end gaming computer has a clock speed of 4GHz, meaning it can make 4 billion calculations per second.

620 sextillion / 4 billion = 155 trillion seconds.

155 trillion seconds / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365 = **4,915,017 years to find all permutations using a modern gaming PC.**

Unless they've got a quantum super-computer, nobody will simply guess, stumble upon, or brute force your seed phrase. **And this is knowing ALL of the words to begin with.**

Hell, even *with* a super computer it‚Äôll still take years to find.

If you don't know every single word for the phrase, **the real calculation is 2048^24**.

Those are the REAL odds you have to worry about.

**TL;DR: You're screwed. Bwahahahahahahahahaha**",2021-10-06 04:35:19

39,q476r0,Tux_fan,I'm from El Salvador...UPDATE 3,536,92,"**It‚Äôs been a while so I‚Äôll give you an update on how things are going.**

* There haven‚Äôt been anti-btc protest since sept 7th. Sept 15th was Independence Day so there were many reasons to the protest. There have been many protests (not btc) but that‚Äôs common in my country, its weird not having a protest between weeks LoL.

**Do people hate btc?**

* Not at all, some are afraid since they don‚Äôt understand, but the main concern is the law. Due to a large history of government corruption, people don‚Äôt trust government, there‚Äôs always a catch in this type of laws. I repeat, this has nothing to do with btc at all but how government handle things.

**Chivo App (official wallet)**

Chivo app is now available to most devices and it works fine most of the time although there are moments when either it‚Äôs on maintenance mode or simply die. There are some cases where chivo app stop working the moment you want to pay‚Ä¶some ‚Äúkarens‚Äù have made a fuss at supermarkets or fast-food restaurants, LoL.

* Lightning network works fine.
* Layer 1 transactions still shows problems. (my $2 are still on the way since sept 8)
* Minor issues when sending money from chivo app to bank account.
* People are still selling the $30 btc bonus for $25 USD cash. (They even use facebook marketplace for promotion LoL. [Here's a pic altough in spanish](https://twitter.com/BairesQuezada/status/1442182539846684673/photo/1))

**Problems with registration**

*I‚Äôll explain this giving some context*, t*he main identification we Salvadoran have is called DUI which stands for ‚ÄúDocumento √önico de Identidad‚Äù (Unique identity document). This ID shows your photo, name, date and place of birth, if your single or married, parents name, your address and a 9-digit number. This number is unique to every person however it‚Äôs not something you maintain in secret. You usually use your DUI to when making a contract or any other legal procedure‚Ä¶or simply use it to prove your not underage when buying alcohol, LoL.*

*By itself, the DUI number it‚Äôs useless, legal documents will also require you to personally sign aside other stuff. You can use your DUI number in raffles, polls and other stuff like that. People can‚Äôt robe or scam you just because you give them your DUI number, so nobody actually cares about keeping the number in secret.*

Now that I explained that, here‚Äôs the issue. To register in chivo app and get your $30 bonus, first you type your phone number, DUI number, take a photo of your DUI and a photo of yourself, and type a security code (your standard KYC). People found out that, to complete the registration process you only need a phone number and DUI number, there is actually no verification of your ID and face photo, just taking a random photo will let you complete the registration.

Some people take advantage of this and start craving for DUI numbers, there many data bases that have hundreds and thousands of DUI numbers, you can usually buy these things for marketing purposes (SMS - emails campaigns, segmentation, etc.). You can also buy a phone number for $1.

You probably can get the idea of what the problem is‚Ä¶now that chivo app is available to most devices, people start discovering that their DUI number has already been registered, so they can‚Äôt use the app and even less get the $30 bonus.

There haven‚Äôt been any official communication from government about this problem however the director of police department said in an interview that people who are doing these things will get arrested, investigations have started. [Here's an article](https://radioyskl.com/2021/10/07/pnc-detendra-en-las-proximas-horas-a-personas-que-suplantaron-identidades-para-acceder-a-los-3000-de-la-chivo-wallet/), altough in spanish, might have to use google translator.

**Remittances**

There are three main ways to send money from overseas to my country.

1. Buy USD with a credit/debit card in chivo website and send directly to a relative‚Äôs chivo app.This has 0 fees although some banks may charge you like US Bank and Bank of America. Wells Fargo and Chase have 0 fees.
2. If for legal reasons you don‚Äôt have a bank account, you can get paid in btc and send it
3. or continue using businesses like Western-Union.

**Btc mining**

The power of volcanoes! ...(sigh)

I‚Äôll be honest and tell you all that this is marketing‚Ä¶at least for today, 2021.

In my country we need to buy (import) electricity from other countries to meet the demand. So don‚Äôt expect a big mining farm from the get go, maybe in 10 years there will be a really big mining farm sustained with clean energy.

Also, we are taking away this clean energy to direct it exclusively to btc. Good for btc, bad for my country. Anyways, thanks to this there might be mayor investments in geothermal energy.

*Geothermal energy needs to be developed through time; it‚Äôs not just finding a vein of water.*

Here is a [presentation with some data](https://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/5-4%20GGDP%20Day2_El%20Salvador.pdf)‚Ä¶although it‚Äôs a decade old, it might give you some insights about geothermal development‚Ä¶it‚Äôs in English btw.

There‚Äôs also the math of the cost of btc mining and the actual gains but since I don¬¥t have any information I¬¥ll skip that for now.

**People‚Äôs behavior**

As I‚Äôve said multiple times, nothing has really changed, we just have a new payment method.

People are starting to know how btc works, the bearish and bullish market, etc. On a daily basis there‚Äôs no difference between USD and btc, people are showing interest in crypto as an investment method and not a currency‚Ä¶most businesses like restaurants and supermarkets accept btc as payment, there are others who only accept USD, either because they‚Äôre against it or don‚Äôt give a shi‚Ä¶ there are others who doesn‚Äôt accept btc because people don‚Äôt show interest in paying with btc.

There was also a big promotion in the price of gas, minus $0.20 for a gallon. However, I don‚Äôt see a big fuss about this‚Ä¶which is weird‚Ä¶ the promotion will end around October 14th so I‚Äôll wait for any data that might come out.

Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt have any data about chivo aside the presidents‚Äô tweets, which I personally don‚Äôt trust as a source. There are some polls out there of how many people uses btc as payment but I still think it‚Äôs to early to get that type of info, consumer behavior wont change in a short period of time.

Truth to be told, foreigners might feel more the hype than Salvadorans LoL.

I'm from Argentina, a rather poor country in South America. We've been having over 40% yearly inflation for four or five years now, and although it's not as bad as Venezuela for example, it's still pretty bad.

No one with a moderate education in Argentina trusts in the government or any other institutions for that matter. We know they are corrupt as hell, that they take our money (Argentina has the highest taxes in the region, and one of the highest in the world) to finance their lifestyle and that there's nothing we can do. What is more, they are completely inept. I mean, every politician steals, but some of them still do their jobs. They still win elections, though, as they give away free money through assistance plans. In a country with over 50% poverty, 70% child poverty, and where most people are uneducated, that wins a ton of votes.

Over the last year, Argentina has seen their politicians:

* [Distribute drugs on public ambulances](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/policiales/2020/08/29/simulaban-ser-medicos-y-repartian-droga-en-una-ambulancia-hay-cuatro-detenidos/) (in a partnership with a local drug lord, of course).
* [Have sex during a virtually-held congress debate](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20200925/483648923058/diputado-argentina-manosea-pechos-pillado-congeso-video.html).
* Our president has criticized Sweden's approach to the pandemic to save his ass from his shitty decision making regarding coronavirus. Argentina has [been declared the worst country to handle the pandemic](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/coronavirus/segun-ranking-bloomberg-argentina-peor-pais-pasar-pandemia-covid-19.phtml), while Sweden was one of the best worldwide.
* During the lockdown period, [some people had to see their kids and parents die](https://www.infobae.com/sociedad/2020/08/21/murio-solange-la-joven-enferma-de-cancer-que-no-pudo-despedirse-de-su-padre-en-cordoba/) because they wouldn't let them travel to the hospital for covid-restrictions (which are supposed to protect health). Meanwhile, the president was privately receiving [visits from the country's top models](https://elintransigente.com/2021/07/escandalo-por-reiteradas-visitas-de-una-modelo-a-alberto-fernandez-en-la-quinta-de-olivos-en-plena-madrugada/) and [hosting exclusive parties in the presidential residence](https://www.infobae.com/politica/2021/08/27/fiesta-en-olivos-alberto-fernandez-fue-tapa-del-financial-times-por-las-fotos-del-cumpleanos-en-plena-cuarentena/).

These are only ‚Äîa few‚Äî examples, but you get the idea. Argentina is a joke, and many citizens ‚Äîmyself included‚Äî believe it's a failed country. That there's no turning back.

I discovered bitcoin at the very start of the pandemic, Q1 2020. The government in Argentina doesn't let people buy foreign currency, so we're stuck with the worthless peso. But crypto is free to acquire, so I'd said what the hell. I bought in at $9k. The timing couldn't be better.

I educated myself, learned about HODL, about the fundamentals. I remember thinking that Satoshi must have lived in Argentina because it solves literally every problem we have. Inflation, corruption, transparency, negligence. Everything.

I automatically fell in love with the concept of Bitcoin and the crypto industry. I kept buying every time I could (I never traded., Don't know how. I just buy and hold, and never sold even a single sat). I also started writing in blogs and forums. I enjoyed it so much that I decided I wanted to make a living out of it. I wanted to help Bitcoin win. I know first-hand what Bitcoin can do for people, for my fellow Argentines, and I wanted to help make that happen. And I was lucky enough I found a company that trusted in me to do that.

Now, I have a full-time job writing about Bitcoin and mining. It's hard, I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes I get heavily overwhelmed by imposter syndrome (English is my third language), but I keep trying anyway, and they are great and very patient with me. I post my articles here sometimes, and you're always my main source of traffic (thanks a lot for that!).

I make 9x what I did working 45 hours a week in Argentina. I get paid in crypto. F\*cking hell, I'm even thinking of buying a house, something I couldn't even consider less than 2 years ago.

I have plans to leave Argentina for Europe next year. I'm currently in Italy getting my citizenship, then I have to turn back to get my stuff, and then I'll return to Italy, gone for good. Bitcoin also helped me do that, as I have access to all my money in just a few clicks.

So to all of you guys out there, know that you don't need Bitcoin to do 1000x for it to change your life. What I put in Bitcoin is not a fortune, and even if I got in very yearly, I didn't make life-changing money. However, by getting into Bitcoin, I did make a life-changing decision.

**TL;DR**

*I was stuck in a dead-end, low-paying job in a failed country. Bought bitcoin and, even if didn't make tons of money off my investment, I took great interest and found a job in the industry. Now I make 9x my former salary and I'm moving to Europe thanks to Bitcoin.*",2021-10-04 14:52:55

We now pursue two corporate strategies in the operation of our business: 

(1)to acquire and hold bitcoin, which we view as a store of value, supported by a robust and public open-sourcearchitecture, that is untethered to sovereign monetary policy and can therefore serve as a hedge against inflation and

Another math: someone here said that current average savings are $2.9K per person. So we can go 23x from here. But I think BTC will go up much more X. At the moment people don't save much, because USD is inflationary. Instead, they spend, or invest in stocks. Once people get used to the idea that saving is a good habit, and you don't need to ""invest"" in stocks or real-estate, then savings rate will increase.

Supporters of the Bitcoin Law may have the last laugh.

46 percent of the population have Chivo Wallet at this time compared to 27% of Salvadorans who have bank accounts as of 2017. The difference is even greater for the low-income Salvadorans.

Salvadorans appear to be converting U.S. dollars into bitcoin and holding onto the digital currency with Bukele tweeted ‚ÄúThe incoming USD quadruples the outflow,‚Äù

Any bitcoin wallet¬†can be used to interact with Salvadoran merchants.¬†

Bitcoin adoption is likely to continue to rise in El Salvador.

The impact of Chivo is likely greater among low-income Salvadorans who have access to smartphones but not banks.

Please keep in mind that I‚Äôm approaching this topic as a PRO-bitcoiner, not a FUD spreader. I may get downvoted to oblivion, but I don‚Äôt care. This is a topic that isn‚Äôt discussed enough, and I don‚Äôt understand why people don‚Äôt think about this more. I‚Äôm invested, and I‚Äôll continue to invest in Bitcoin for the next few years. So here goes‚Ä¶

My biggest fear is that the CIA/Government created Bitcoin and is planning an eventual rug pull that will lead to the biggest wealth transfer in world history into the hands of the elites. 

Think about it. Who would want a Central Bank Digital Currency from the government? Nobody. 

Enter Bitcoin. Built upon the hashing algorithm SHA-256 (which was originally designed by the NSA), and created by some supposedly benevolent, anonymous creator (Satoshi Nakamoto) with a name that literally translates to ‚ÄúCentral Intelligence‚Äù in Japanese. People flock to it with the dream that it will help them conquer the corrupt financial system by hedging against inflation and allowing them to make decentralized transactions. As it picks up adoption‚Ä¶celebrities, bankers, and big companies start buying it up. Enamored by promises of wealth and financial freedom, everyone ignores the uncomfortable fact that the creator of Bitcoin has 1 million coins and could easily tank the market just by activating his wallet. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead or forgot his keys‚Äù we reassure ourselves. 

By 2030, 80%-90% of the worlds population has invested their wealth and savings into this digital asset. Suddenly, Satoshi‚Äôs wallet wakes up one day and begins to sell-off massive amounts of Bitcoin. Major investors rush to liquidate their holdings as the price plunges into a free-fall collapse. Within 24 hours, the value of Bitcoin is decimated. Millions across the world lose their life savings. But it‚Äôs to late. Satoshi (or the elite group who may be Satoshi) have transferred the bulk of the world‚Äôs wealth to themselves. 

At this point, the world governments and banks swoop in to offer their new traceable, trackable, controllable digital currency. 

Revelation 13:16-17: ‚ÄúIt also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.‚Äù

That‚Äôs my biggest fear. Never in history have the elites lost control of the financial system. And I think it‚Äôs short-sighted to believe they don‚Äôt have a plan for Bitcoin. I‚Äôll still keep buying it in the short term as it‚Äôs making me money. But I‚Äôm not going to be a 10-30+ year HODLER like everyone else. In the next 5 years, I‚Äôll be transferring all my crypto into physical assets like food, land, etc‚Ä¶ Call it FUD, call it what you want. Nobody knows who Satoshi is though. Nobody knows why he hasn‚Äôt touched his wallets which contain a massive amount of wealth. And no, ‚Äúhe forgot his keys‚Äù isn‚Äôt a valid argument. You really think the man who designed Bitcoin couldn‚Äôt keep track of his own keys? 

The only possible explanation that could absolve us of any worry is that he is dead. And that‚Äôs a big gamble for the long-term. No sane human would leave that amount of wealth untouched while alive, unless they had a nefarious purpose and were waiting to sell it until a later date to facilitate the biggest wealth transfer in world history.

EDIT: Really appreciate the constructive replies that actually address my points instead of bashing me for a Bible verse. Whether you believe in the Bible or not isn‚Äôt important, my primary arguments about Satoshi still stand regardless. The verse at the end was an added effect that I probably could have excluded without detracting from my original points. Although, based on the numerous comments accusing me of being on drugs, excluding the verse may have made no difference. Again, I genuinely appreciate the thoughtful replies, and I‚Äôm glad we can have a constructive discussion.

EDIT: Please stop harping on Bitcoin being ‚Äúopen source‚Äù. When one man/group owns 1 million Bitcoin, he/they don‚Äôt need to backdoor bitcoin‚Äôs code. A simple movement of the wallet or a sell off would tank the market. No, 1 million out of 21 million isn‚Äôt a massively large fraction, but anyone who has been in crypto for 5 minutes knows how the news cycle affects the volatility. If you really believe Bitcoin wouldn‚Äôt tank after the first headline ‚ÄúSatoshi‚Äôs wallet awakens/begins to sell‚Äù, then you‚Äôre deluding yourself. Again, ‚Äúopen source‚Äù doesn‚Äôt matter when 1 million coins are controlled by the creator.",2021-10-01 23:32:42

His answer was property (land). He said that he should have been investing more into property to hedge against inflation. Technically, he's not wrong.

I even added ""Hey, if you bought some Bitcoin 10 years ago you'd be doing great right now"". He even acknowledged that if he had bought bitcoin 10 years ago he would be a billionaire, but they immediately shrugged the topic off and went back to talking about property.

828,q00f4p,Progress_8,Bitcoin has unleashed a wave of speculation and increase popularity!,80,7,"Key takeaways from this Bloomberg article about crypto in El Salvador:

Chivo wallet makes it easy to switch between crypto and dollars.

Chivo can be faster than cash or credit cards.

More than 2 million people in the country of 6.5 million are users of Chivo.

Many large chains such as Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs, supermarkets, and some smaller businesses are accepting the digital currency for purchases.

Bitcoin has unleashed a wave of speculation.

Cryptocurrency tradings are becoming much more popular in El Salvador.

Successful rollout produces tangible benefits for the impoverished Central American economy.

Remittances account for over 20% of the nation's GDP. Reduction in remittance fees is one of the main benefits.

Salvadorians utilizing Bitcoin alongside the U.S. dollar could convince other countries to give cryptocurrency a try too.

I understand the risks of leverage and trading and I have plans to keep my liquidation level very far and practically impossible to get margin-called even with a 30 flash crash.

Plus my question is mostly for research purposes. So please tell me what I need to know about the impact of daily funding rates on an indefinite leveraged long or short position.

I asked if any of them ever remitted money home (I had to bring it up) and they all said freely that they do every week. I got some weird looks for this question so I explained my interest in bitcoin and how El Salvador was a big deal for people in the space. 

At that point they understood where I was coming from, relaxed a bit, and the most talkative of the group mentioned they were all using Chivo now. She asked if I had heard of it. Of course I was excited, responded yes, and asked if they preferred Chivo to their previous way of remitting money. Again the most talkative of group said when she used to send $50 usd home each week through Western Union, it would cost her $8 in fees and would take days to arrive. She excitedly said now it‚Äôs free and instant for them and it‚Äôs very helpful to their families in El Salvador. At one point she said, ‚ÄúThis is from Bukele‚Äôs bitcoin, so we like it.‚Äù which cracked me up. 

This happened in NW Oregon mind you. It was a serendipitous and surreal experience as someone who is deeply interested in the global bitcoin movement. Thought I‚Äôd share with the sub.

90,q3xexe,M-A-L,Bitcoin-based DeFi in El Salvador,62,11,"Yesterday saw the announcement of an interesting collaboration in El Salvador between a national bank (Banco Hipotecario) and Sovryn, an open-source Bitcoin-based DeFi platform. Sovryn allows people to utilize their Bitcoin for such things as lending, facilitating decentralized trading and so on.  

I think it's incredibly massive news for Bitcoin (as well as for the people in El Salvador). Using DeFi services is quite another step to take for the average person, and the bank effectively helps people getting used to the idea that it is safe and secure. It further entrenches the embrace of Bitcoin, undermining any argument for the need to widen adoption to include other cryptocurrencies. No SOV is needed to use Bitcoin on the platform. Sovryn aims to offer the full DeFi suit (including NFTs, stablecoins, mortgages, etc.), all based on the usage and security of Bitcoin. A national bank will effectively teach people to use their Bitcoin (and softens onboarding), using a decentralized platform that is just as available without any bank. These seem to me the realistic steps to the eventual demise of the centralized banking world and a Bitcoin-based financial system.    

The vision of the future that starts to emerge from the adoption in El Salvador is that of a system consisting of Bitcoin + Lightning + RSK + Bitcoin-based DeFi. Little else seems needed.

MOST, but not all, humans are jealous, envious, and scared creatures.

While some friends might be happy for you, if your lifestyle changes dramatically, it will cause friction. Imagine you have a group of friends where no one owns a home, and then 3 years later one guy owns a home and has a nice car. It will create friction. Beyond the money, bitcoin is an attack of the normal life. If you are a bitcoiner, you probably do not believe we should accept the status quo. You aren't afraid to have different beliefs. You are okay being the weird one.

What exacerbates these differences is how fast the financial and social changes are happening and why it happens-the person will say ""I bought bitcoin"" and to most people the only acceptable answer is ""I worked for it"". The bitcoiner did work for it -they put time researching and took their savings into bitcoin, and also took risk-but to most they will be viewed as lucky.

What hurt my friendship is the other person likes to be the top dawg and now is scared. His reaction to being scared is to lash out. So, if I could give advice-if you have friends who are not where they want to be financially (I guess this is 99% of us), and they are not going to buy bitcoin (or research no matter what you say), if you want to preserve the friendship, maybe it's better to just smile and nod.

Also, I have met several people who share common beliefs. Important: we disagree on a lot...but with several people I've met in the community, we share a common set of values. And perhaps that's what is happening-bitcoin is exposing that some of my friends and I don't share common values.",2021-10-07 19:38:52

All things being equal, bitcoin helps level the table back out. It's **not** about free wealth it's about not being robbed for the first time in generations. Massive difference here people. 

&#x200B;

Bitcoin is hope.

Every normal citizen of every country in the world is being robbed every single year through currency inflation. This mandatory inflation is an oppressive force, limiting our life opportunity and robbing us of hope for our future and our children's future because for every step we take forward, we're pushed two steps back as the value of the cash we worked for erodes over time. Worst of all is that we have no choice to opt out and are coerced by law to partake in this violated social contract.

But since the value of bitcoin does not erode, the value of our time cannot be stolen from us, giving us hope for a better future where there is less disparity, less unethics, less competition, less corruption and the energy we put into working can actually be enough to not just get by but actually get ahead.

Bitcoin allows for a world where an average person with no extraordinary skill can finally have the time, privilege and resources to pursue the kind of life is most meaningful to them, not just the life they fall into and get stuck in with no hope of escaping.

**This is bitcoin.**

As long as BTC appreciation rate is higher than the interest rate, you can continue borrow money the next year, using the new borrowed money to pay the loan from preceding year and continue this practice indefinitely. 
2. I think the benefit of this is you don't pay tax and you can use the money for living. But I want to know the second half of the story.

I always had slogans like ""Big Banks are evil"" and ""They steal our wealth"" in the back of my mind but I never followed up on these claims. That was until said interview. I went on this very sub-reddit and asked Bitcoiners to point me towards something where I can start to learn about the flaws and fallacies in our economy and our financial system. I was referred to the Hidden Secrets of Money Series with Mike Maloney and Saifedean Ammous The Bitcoin Standard. After that I followed the links, the signs, the mentions, the recommendations, the references, the suggestions and I went down A DEEP RABBIT HOLE!!! Not kidding, I spent roughly 500 to 600 hours over the last 6 month reading every book and every article I found, watching every video and listening to tons of podcasts on the topic. And it changed my entire world view, my approach on financial matters and my strategy for long term investing. I am humble enough to know that I still know nothing at all... but one thing I have taken away from this is that people who are not familiar with Bitcoin must not underestimate the NON-FINANCIAL POSITIVE EFFECT a Bitcoin Deep Dive can have on you as an individual. I feel like my laser eyes are slowly starting to glow and they burnt the veil of bullshit mainstream propaganda right off my face. Bitcoin has led me to Mises, Rothbart, Taleb, Hayek and many more. I have an entire shelf on my reading list, and which each book I feel more empowered. Bitcoin has done this. Thus, the thing I am preaching now to friends and family is the following:

791,q0fbga,PrognosticalSon,"Unpopular opinion: Collateralized loans will move BTC from retail to institutions, who will get even richer.",28,43,"LTV of loans of 50% (or other %) make it so you can only ever get half (or a partial) of the BTC you loaned out back. 
 
Meaning, many people plan on buying more BTC with the loan money, and while in theory it seems like it will work, it will just end up enriching institutions.
 
The reason is this: *The only thing anyone  does with your lent Bitcoin is sell/short it.* That's it, there is no other use case for lenders wanting your BTC.

When loaning bitcoin you are essentially selling half of your coin into the market, putting downward pressure on it. Maybe some shorts gets rekt, and they pay the coin back, but gess what? The institutions loan out your coins to be sold *again*. As long as your coins are loaned, they are adding to sell pressure.

Why will institutions get richer? Because if even only a percentage of people have bought bitcoin with their collateral, and the price is able to be dropped, folks will be liquidating their bitcoin they bought with the loan to pay it back, adding to sell pressure already in the market. Sure some may have other sources of funds to top up the loan but this is an exception, rather than the rule.

If the price keeps dropping, this is where the institutions lick their lips as they watch our LTV dip below 50%. The loan is now under collateralized, either making us give them *even more* BTC to cover the gap, which they they then of course short, or we liquidate our BTC collateral to cover the loan, giving our coins to the institutions, one way or another.

Volatility needs to be much lower, and market cap needs to be much higher for this to work in our favor. But guess what? By the time this happens, institutions will be lending *us* bitcoin which we will hold dearly, because we hope it beats inflation and the loan interest rate. And by us I mean only those who can afford to post the collateral for bitcoin.

TLDR;
They wont have to court you for your coins, you will give them up willingly for a fiat loan. Price drops will be engineered to call your loans. Much later they will loan BTC back to you, and then you will hodl it. Don't lend out your BTC, you will miss it.",2021-10-03 10:37:04

Currently, all debts on the government level are denominated in USD. Want to buy oil? Good luck without having USD. Want to global trade? It won't happen without USD. Examples are endless, and there is one result: HUGE demand for US dollars on a global level.

It's human nature that you don't want to depend on external factors and use something you can't control. The US can print the dollars to infinity and export it as it's product to all other nations (with little to no consequences on its domestic economy). Before 1971 all was fine, as USD was a gold certificate. Nixon temporarily suspended that convertibility, and now, over 50 years from that event, we are still in fiat. What is the impact of this? Countries have to suck it up, deal with it, and use US dollar. Since 1971 this setup always had a negative impact on their economy. Now everything might change.

El Salvador was first, Brazil will follow, and the domino effect soon can't be stopped. Everyone will realize the escape from the US Ponzi system is already here, and the adoption will be driven by the most powerful force on this planet: the human desire to cause damage and change as a result of unfair advantage, this time aimed towards US and USD.

405,q2m8ha,ComfortableSwimmer92,"To further cement u/PizzaOnTheRoof556's point about the odds of correctly guessing his seed phrase (1 in 2048!), here's a puny 52!, for scale.",22,2,"From: [https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html](https://czep.net/weblog/52cards.html)

They seem harmless enough, 52 thin slices of laminated cardboard with  colorful designs printed on their sides.  Yet, as another illustration  of the mantra that complexity begins from the most simple systems, the  number of variations that these 52 cards can produce is virtually  endless.  The richness of most playing card games owes itself to this  fact.

The number of possible permutations of 52 cards is 52!.  I think the  exclamation mark was chosen as the symbol for the factorial operator to  highlight the fact that this function produces surprisingly large  numbers in a very short time.  If you have an old school pocket  calculator, the kind that maxes out at 99,999,999, an attempt to  calculate the factorial of any number greater than 11 results only in  the none too helpful value of ""Error"".  So if 12! will break a typical  calculator, how large is 52!?

52! is the number of different ways you can arrange a single deck of  cards.  You can visualize this by constructing a randomly generated  shuffle of the deck.  Start with all the cards in one pile.  Randomly  select one of the 52 cards to be in position 1.  Next, randomly select  one of the remaining 51 cards for position 2, then one of the remaining  50 for position 3, and so on.  Hence, the total number of ways you could  arrange the cards is 52 \* 51 \* 50 \* ... \* 3 \* 2 \* 1, or 52!.  Here's  what that looks like:

80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000

This number is beyond astronomically large.  I say beyond astronomically  large because most numbers that we already consider to be  astronomically large are mere infinitesmal fractions of this number.   So, just how large is it?  Let's try to wrap our puny human brains  around the magnitude of this number with a fun little theoretical  exercise.  Start a timer that will count down the number of seconds from  52! to 0.  We're going to see how much fun we can have before the timer  counts down all the way.

**Start by picking your favorite spot on the equator.  You're going to  walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace  of one step every billion years.  Make sure to pack a deck of playing cards, so you can get in a few  trillion hands of solitaire between steps.  After you complete your  round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean.   Now do the same thing again:  walk around the world at one billion years  per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time  you circle the globe.**

**Continue until the ocean is empty.  When it is, take one sheet of  paper and place it flat on the ground.  Now, fill the ocean back up and  start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the  stack each time you‚Äôve emptied the ocean.**

**Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun.   Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits  haven‚Äôt even changed.  You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go.     So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again.  One  thousand times more.   Unfortunately, that still won‚Äôt do it.  There are  still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining.  You‚Äôre just about a third  of the way done.**

**To pass the remaining time, start shuffling your deck of cards.  Every  billion years deal yourself a 5-card poker hand.  Each time you get a  royal flush, buy yourself a lottery ticket.  If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand  Canyon.  Keep going and when you‚Äôve filled up the canyon with sand,  remove one ounce of rock from Mt. Everest.  Now empty the canyon and  start all over again.  When you‚Äôve levelled Mt. Everest, look at the  timer, you still have 5.364e67 seconds remaining.    You barely made a dent.  If you were to repeat this 255 times, you would  still be looking at 3.024e64 seconds.  The timer would finally reach  zero sometime during your 256th attempt.  Of course, in reality none of this could ever happen.  Sorry to break it  to you.  The truth is, the Pacific Ocean will boil off as the Sun  becomes a red giant before you could even take your fifth step in your  first trek around the world.  Somewhat more of an obstacle, however, is  the fact that all the stars in the universe will eventually burn out  leaving space a dark, ever-expanding void inhabited by a few scattered  elementary particles drifting a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute  zero.  The exact details are still a bit fuzzy, but according to some  reckonings of The Reckoning, all this could happen before you would've  had a chance to reduce the vast Pacific by the amount of a few backyard  swimming pools.**",2021-10-06 15:00:25

The founder was working for NZs second largest bank as their Corporate Strategy Manager when they registered Easycrypto with the NZ companies Office.

Nine months after establishing Easycrypto the Founder/CEO moved to work in an executive strategic role for NZs national airline AirNZ where a former PM of NZ and current chairman of the largest NZ bank (US majority shareholder owned) is a board member. The ex PM and chairman of NZs largest bank was very fond of the AirNZ CEO and nominated him to be the National parties Next leader and so subsequently the CEO Christopher Luxon was elected to parliament and is biding his time to take leadership of the now opposition National party. The National party is known for its close relationship with the US owned banks that dominate the NZ banking sector.

Anyway now this close associate of both of NZs largest banks not only operates the largest crypto platform but is also opening a investment vehicle designed to attract investors to Bitcoin by holding the custody of the Bitcoin in foreign funds.

This type of fund argues that many people don't want the trouble of holding their own Bitcoin and dealing with the tax complications and so they will hold the Bitcoin for you while charging an annual 2.5% fee. They hope to do a deal with the NZ government tax department allowing the fund members to be only taxed on an assumed and fixed rate of return of 5% instead of taxation on actual gains or losses...although the NZ IRD does not appear to have yet agreed to this deal.

This looks like the commodification of Bitcoin by bankers.

They offer the government a secure tax stream and themselves a secure income while the investors take all the risk but hold no real custody or control over the Bitcoin.

Such funds could be designed to move toward a scenario where Bitcoin can only be held by such institutional custodians and not held directly by citizens- this is of course a complete undermining and subversion of the entire Bitcoin ethos and values.

The bankers cartel are afraid of Bitcoin because its superior integrity is attracting more and more citizens to move their savings from fiat shitcoin to Bitcoin integrity.

Their corporate strategy managers are looking for all and every way they can capture and control and ultimately neuter Bitcoin.

I hope they fail as enough of us are aware of their intentions and will never surrender our coins and hopes of change to their corrupt rentseeking custody!",2021-10-05 21:31:48

Prior to said dip, I first bought BTC like five years ago to save fees on gambling sites and ordering fun stuff on the dark web. FML. Fast forward a few years and I started investing in BTC in small amounts at a time just because I thought it would grow. It did grow, and grow fast. But then dat musk energy fud dip. During that dip I was able to:
 
1) At least double my position, if not more.
 
2) Read and study BTC. This was the biggest eye opener. Just wish I did this back in the 2015-2016 time frame when I first purchased. I would have bought a shit ton. I won‚Äôt elaborate too much but I would encourage any newbies to try and understand the technology. It might be greatest engineering marvel of our lifetime.
 
3) Started to take security seriously. With that I did the following:
-offloaded most to cold storage.
-got metal plate for seed
-diversified online holdings to three different exchanges (prevent loss of too much if they fuck up, such as getting hacked or run with our crypto)
-took extra measures at those exchanges to ensure security on my end by getting a Yubikey and adding 2FA.
-got blockfi credit card and get sats for each purchase.
 
Finally feel like I am in good place and have my ducks in a row for this thing to moon. Now that all this shit is taken care of, I can pack my bags.

If I didn't have hours to read about Bitcoin, I would not buy Bitcoin because I would not have any reason to and it would look and feel like a complete scam. In the same way that cash looks like a scam to a chimp. Would a chimp accept $1 over a banana? No. $1 looks like a total scam. Yet is is obvious to a human that $1 has some sort of purchasing power in the future.

In fact doing so would ostracize them from their stronghold in an elite community that is cult like in ignoring the obvious. The obvious fact is that central banks are running Ponzi schemes with low discount rates that allow them to persist for decades, even centuries, as long as they expand above that rate. QE and immigration is needed as a supplement since advanced nations' populations fail to reproduce themselves, let alone grow. I relate this oversight similar to religious people who continue to believe in the impossible, yet all evidence around them at all times point to the obvious. The system cannot be fixed from within! International, intergenerational Ponzi schemes cannot be unwound or forgiven. Socialism results as the ultimate Ponzi scheme as each generation steals from the next until nothing is left work for and society collapses. Something new must emerge from outside to take it's place and by refusing to look outside of the box that central banks' created will only keep society in a catch 22. That predicament is one of increased state control at the cost of the individual. It is almost like the system of a debt based fiat currency is designed to consolidate wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of the many. Fortunately, new systems are in place that decentralize the power and naturally increase the safety and security of society in the process. Yes, the current financial system will be forced to invest in that system for their short term financial livelihood at the expense of their long term economic freedom. That catch 22 is the exact opposite of the system they created that forces the individual into debt as a short term benefit but long term imprisonment.",2021-10-08 00:50:27

775,q0ik4w,fomoFace,Will scams increase exponentially when BTC becomes the main currency?,12,36,"Shower thought: The 'scammability' of Bitcoin will not increase **linearly** with adoption increase rather **exponentially** since the early adopters (who joined voluntarily) are harder to scam than the later tech-ignorant ones (who would be forced to join due to Bitcoin becoming a standard).

Elaboration (if needed): At this point in time, I would assume that the vast majority of BTC holders are also BTC savvy to some extent. Since BTC at this point is not obligatory, the individuals opting in are the individuals who know about Bitcoin and (hopefully) how not to get scammed or phished.

However, if Bitcoin becomes the main currency, it will pretty much need to be adopted by everyone, including the very old, very young, and tech-ignorant people.

For example: If Mr. Bad Guy has an 80-year old tech-ignorant neighbor, chances are at this point that he can't steal BTC from the old guy because the old guy doesn't have any. However, if Bitcoin becomes the currency for everyone, he can be sure that his 80-year-old tech-ignorant neighbor has BTC and with very little effort (""Hey, can I borrow your phone?"") the old man will loose all his fortune.

This, of course, would be much less of an issue if Bitcoin would be traceable. I know I'm veering a bit from my own topic, but do you agree that if the world will run on a single unified currency, it should be a traceable one? (Sure, a non-traceable currency has its benefits, but for majority of the world population, there are more benefits than loses to tracabillity having tracabillity on their hard-earned life savings.)",2021-10-03 14:13:58

768,q0l0l4,spinbarkit,"hi, my modest input to this (amazing) community",11,28,"I wanted to share some insight based on a research I made. Of course I must clearly state here that I am firm BTC believer, I agree with all basic BTC ideas presented in most mainstream BTC papers preached by BTC community (freaks, lets be honest). BTW, it's not supposed to be treated as financial advice or in any way perceived as such - just my own, personal opinion. I lost all my BTC in boating accident. BUY & HODL for life. I am nobody's dog (except my wife wouldn't agree).

Now, there is some unsolved dispute that I encountered here and there on different BTC forums. It pops from time to time depending on the market current status. It is ""**mine vs hold**"". It's buy your own miners and mine your own BTC at home vs buy BTC (from exchanges or DEX or whatever or from a guy in the black hood in the light of full moon in the dark alley paying with your body) then transfer to cold wallet, HODL and never sell, thats it.

Depending on multiple factors like: home vs flat, budget, tech skill, knowledge, perseverance, local electricity price etc., a person (possessed by Bitcoin) with pile of cash but limited resources may also consider ""buy and host"" option. Of course, what one can often read: ""all hosting service are scam"", or ""why would anyone let you mine BTC from his miner and take profit from it, if he could just profit himself"", or ""even if you dont get scammed, ""buy and hold"" is a bit smaller profit but its 100% safe, and moreover ""mining is far from costeffective and its never worth your while"", ""let the pro do it for the security of the network as they are gifted by God with free electricty, there is no money in it"".

Well, the only thing I can agree is that buy and hold is safe option, whereas I cant agree with all the rest quakery bullshit. Why? How do I know that? What entitles me to say such a thing? ""He's with them! Shill! GTFO scammer!""- NO. Chill Winston, I am with nobody, I am on nobodys payroll, I dont advertise anything here. In my opinion large companies may find themselves in a situation forcing them to cut risks (transfering them to clients) or increase their cash flow (money upfront). All I want to say is this - what is repeated in many BTC books - don't trust, verify. So? I simply ran some numbers in a financial model I created. I am about to share the results. Free gratis. Just to contribute. To ease your own judgement. So remember this is done for BUY & HOST option, not for solo/pool mining.

\# **assumptions:**

\- 10 year period (5 years in banking models  is tops I know but I wanted to show more)

**-** initial investment - 50k$ (1BTC for HODL)

\- BTC increases 30% in value per annum starting point is 09.21 - 43k$

\- electricity price 0,063$ per KWH, power consumption 3,3 KW

\- mining efficiency daily - 0,0006, 0,0005, 0,0004 BTC (3 scenarios) including 5% drop per eachASIC per annum. I also took into account 10% availability factor (power outages, delayedrestarts, software failures etc.)

\- ASIC life expectancy is 24 months (assumed warranty), price 10k$ per unit (we buy 5 units)

\- we don't reinvest profits, once we buy - we hodl, once one ASIC dies - its finito. BUT we stillprofit from mined BTC price increase

\- of course I can change all variables at will, recalculating whole model in seconds

**# methods:**

excel vba, data input taken arbitrarily from google (you can input anything you want, it's livemodel)

**# results:**

1. trying out many scenarios I gathered that what influences our profits the most is 3 things:

\- how long ASICs live (strong factor)

\- mining efficiency (should be considered important but not crucial for mining outcome)

\- BTC price (very strong factor)

2) what doesn't really matter is price of ASIC (profits outweigh investment), electricity price

**# conclusions:**

\- holding is nice &safe but nowhere near profitable as mining, provided BTC rises and we usetop tier machines

\- reinvesting profits in new ASICS only exponentialy rises our profits, temporarily decreasingmoney flow which after 5 years is strictly residual and can be successfully discounted as noise

I expect a lot of critique as it's very productive in discovering new things. I don't post often so be gentle please. NOTE- I may be wrong - if so I appologise. I did my best though.... OR you all folks already know mining is the way... have fun good luck. May the BTC CAT watch over you guys!

Found out that this was a good decision. lost some while trading on bybit. fuck that shit. stopped trading after i lost around a good piece of my portfolio cake. but never lost hope it the whole thing. kept educating me about bitcoin. never felt for the altcoin seduction. it got bloody in the crash. but never lost hope. even not in july where i was partly down \~10 % - felt pretty fucked up - imagening the fact that, if never started trading i could have sold at 200% during my first (part)bullrun. but hey, i think i got the message. in math we trust. bought again at 45k in the crash. had no fiat to buy the bottom of the crash at 30k. but i bougt again in may at 45k and again a few days ago at 41k, after selling my remaining stocks. 

Reading all your stories and listening to people like michael saylor (i know...bitcoin doesnt need anyone) ...but never the less... this all made me pretty calm in my inner self concerning all the smoke and flashlights/FUD around BTC. - Still can't believe i eventhough i am irresponibly long on BTC for my league - all in.

to come back to my point...

i have some smart friends. but none of them seem interested in bitcoin. doesnt matter how much i preach them. Bitcoin, its faith and its possible rise seems to be a much too fantastic theme to be true...no one seems to believe it. OR they think its to late XD

Details: In a tweet on Saturday, Balchunas wrote that Bitcoin Future ETFs filed under a 1940 law have a 75% chance of approval this month.

Numbers: Balchunas believes that there are 2-1 odds that ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF gets approved this month. Galaxy Bitcoin Strategy ETF has 50-1 odds, he writes.

Recent Events: On Friday, the SEC delayed its decision on whether or not Bitcoin ETFs would finally get approved.

Final Thoughts: A Bitcoin ETF would give investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without having to actually own the coins.

30,q488jq,Bakfiets13,Bitcoin Fractional Reserve banking,9,14,"My case is as follows:

With potentially more financial institutions (funds, banks, etc.) owning Bitcoin and providing financial services using Bitcoin in the future, what will prevent a system of fractional reserve banking from occurring with Bitcoin? I mean, let's say, hypothetically, many people would hold Bitcoin at their bank as part of their savings (bank is the custodian), the same method of holding just a fraction of total Bitcoin savings at the bank to be directly available for withdrawal could used by banks right? This would effectively mean that the total number of Bitcoins 'owned' is greater than the actual Bitcoins in existence. I would say this is problematic.

782,q0hgbb,Phantazma94,ASIC miner not running on promised hashrate (Canaan Avalon 1246),9,17,"Ordered two ASICs from Alibaba (shame on me). 

When testing both devices, they both showed the promised 85TH. After a while, results got worse which I contributed to my basement being to warm. Set up a two-room-system (ASICS getting cold air and blowing into another room), improved my internet connection, set up special ports for the ASICs, etc. - I also had an Electrician come and set everything up safely and with enough electricity. 

Still, one of them is shutting down and both are running maximally at 70TH instead of 85TH (or lets say at least 80 would be nice). 

What confuses me: 

\- after changing the pool, both ran at 85+ for 2-3 hours and then dropped down (I did NOT have them off for a long time before that) 

\- temperatures are looking great 

\- Log shows a ""bad pool"" although I tried three different ones and all with the correct European server

\- no matter if I run the ASIC on high or normal, it gets to exactly 70TH in both instances

For the past three years, I have used mostly the same strategy for buying BTC:

\- every Monday I look at the indicators which are important for me (BTC fear & greed, Puell multiple)

\- when they are below my ""overheated"" threshold, I buy, and otherwise I wait for better times

\- the more pessimistic the indicators are, the more I buy (again, using my own thresholds)

However, for selling and re-accumulating, I do not have a good rule. I did sell (""DCA out"") some BTC this spring, and re-bought that in Q3 during the dip. But in hindsight, I should have sold more, and closer to the peak.

Do any of you have a strategy for maximizing BTC accumulation that you are happy with? Should I keep an eye on indicators like the ""Pi Cycle Top"" for better guidance?

Ideally, I would want to buy when the market is low, do nothing when it becomes overheated, sell when it is close to the top (I realize you can never time the top anyway), and re-buy when the market cools down again.

Please ignore tax implications; in our tax system, it makes no difference whether I hold my assets in BTC or fiat currency, and how often I buy or sell.

Long-term wise, the results drastically changed to the point I gained 0 new student through BTC, I posted on Jobs4Btc, BitcoinTalk.

‚ÄãLast week, I stumbled upon an old Medium post from venture capitalist Chris McCann. The venture capitalist took a look at the data and concluded that, in 2018, we were early to Bitcoin.

Are we still there? Are we still following the same trend of exponential growth?

I revisited and updated the graphs to find out:  


**Bitcoin Wallet Address Growth**

The first metric: unique Bitcoin wallet addresses. The amount of total Bitcoin wallets today is closing in on 900 million. In May 2018, the number was about 398 million, which, in turn, forty months before was about 60 million.

https://preview.redd.it/pz9ncaayngr71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b42080a908c125a5810f97351e79e90ae9484c8

So growth is slowing somewhat, although if we compare it to overall internet adoption, it‚Äôs tracking closely, as the rate of internet user growth leveled off over time as well.

It was in the 12th year of public use that the internet crossed one billion users, while Bitcoin is closing in on a billion addresses in its 13th year.

Then again, an address is not equivalent to a user, so it‚Äôs a bit more of a toss-up. Still, a doubling in three years is nothing to scoff at.

&#x200B;

**Active Bitcoin Addresses:**

So how many of those addresses are actually active (that is, have sent or received any quantity of Bitcoin on a given day)? 

Take a look:

https://preview.redd.it/fyroytt1ogr71.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ca5094dd6f2bd62aa0a969a9a771bd97b7ac86f

For Bitcoin, two new peaks were reached in January and May of 2021 at approximately 1.25 million active wallets per day. The previous local peak was approximately 1.1 million in late 2017. Things in late 2017 looked to be going parabolic until transactions dropped down to 500,000/day in early 2018.

To me, this graph reflects on some of the transactional limitations related to Bitcoin. While there are definitely solutions to some of the volume-related problems surrounding Bitcoin, it‚Äôs possible that the slowing growth is correlated.

While it‚Äôd be impossible to collect the data for all cryptocurrencies, I‚Äôd postulate that growth is quite a bit higher for crypto as a whole. With 12,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, however, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to do the math.

&#x200B;

**Lightning Network Capacity:**

Addressing the volume limitations I touched on earlier is the Lightning Network, a system of nodes that allows Bitcoin transactions to be settled nearly instantaneously. Below is a graph of the lightning network's capacity. The red line is the capacity in $BTC, the blue its capacity in dollars.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f5sgeq86ogr71.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2ceb062ae4fd50186dcccc5908619ecf3e91544

This is the most bullish news for Bitcoin we've come across in this set of graphs. Lightning nodes cost time, effort, and money to operate, and if node operators weren't making money, they wouldn't set these nodes up.

This graph looks to be nearing parabolic levels, and it spells good news for crypto. It's impossible to say if this network will be immediately adopted or have a crazy high volume of transactions, but the node operators, who are the biggest stakeholders in this network, seem to be quite optimistic.

&#x200B;

**So...Are We Early?**

In 2018, many graphs pointed to Bitcoin taking the same path as the internet to complete world domination. Today, though, it‚Äôs harder to have that same level of optimism.

While at this point, we know Bitcoin won‚Äôt be quicker to worldwide adoption than the internet, at this point in time, it's on a good track to eventually get there.

Here‚Äôs what we can state with certainty:

1. Growth in the Bitcoin world has slowed down.
2. Things have never been so bullish for Bitcoin.
3. It's increasingly unlikely that bitcoin price action will have the 10x, 50x, and 1000x potential of previous cycles.

While McCann in 2018 could fairly compare the growth of crypto and bitcoin to the growth of the internet as a whole, perhaps today, making that comparison is a little too optimistic.",2021-10-04 16:36:24

837,pzymip,xxadmxx,Null Point Asset,6,10,"Bitcoin is an asset of finite supply. The value of this quality cannot be understated. 

Our economic system is an oscillating system. Anything that oscillates stably, does so around a fixed/strong null point. In fact, it is the only way that intelligible oscillations can be understood. Oscillations that occur around a weak null point or foundation are destined to break down (out of necessity).

By having a finite supply, Bitcoin functions as a null point within the economic system. Bitcoin, by way of its finite supply, is able to perform a valuable function. What bitcoin does for value, is the same thing that a meter stick does for standard measurements in engineering. Assets of finite supply intend to function so that they approximate true value. Just as a meter stick can measure the exact value of a meter, assets of finite supply intend to do this for other assets. In other words, they seek to move the idea of value from a subjective realm to an objective one. Not only does it perform this diagnostic function, but it serves as an anchor for polarized economic schemes. The most apparent of these polarized schemes would be the fiat system.

Fiat currency schemes have no hard limit on the ability to inflate or deflate. Their supply is neither capped nor ensured existence (though the use of violence and strategy has been employed relatively successfully for this aim). Fiat is an amorphous shadow in comparison to true value. It is constantly moving. It gains and recedes as the times do. 

By investing into null point assets, one is in effect harnessing the power of the null point. No longer will people be subject to the whims of a seemingly uncontrollable economic scheme. Inflation and deflation will no longer be dirty words. They will be tools. We will employ those tools to generate untold wealth (on the way up and down). No longer will economics be an esoteric art. BTC brings economics under the wing of science.

I wanted to send btc on my laptop to an address that I had on my phone and also had the qr code. So how to transfer the address to the laptop? Well, since my laptop has a camera, I just googled some online qr code reader and scanned the qr code on my phone, childs play.

Well I'm a little nervous when I had to make on-chain transactions and thank God I am! I double checked every character and it turned out that the online qr code reader messed up one character! Is this a common mistake that qr code readers miss? I never had an issue like this before (altough I did not scan much btc addresses, mostly just websites and the like).

So since then I'm super careful what to use in cases like this. Watch out and be alert!

However, I am somewhat apprehensive of buying P2P because I have heard stories of people having their BTC rejected from exchanges like Coinbase because it had gone through coinjoin, etc.

Three questions for you:

1. How do I tell, **before** the transfer happens?

Fortunately, it seems that numbers of customers investing in Bitcoin are increasing. In Australia it is currently at around 1 in 11 people owning Bitcoin. I tried to find a graph of this statistic over the last ten years but it seems people have only started doing surveys recently.

Hopefully, due to network effects, this number will keep increasing. When half of all people own some Bitcoin, there will be a strong business case for companies to start accepting it. It's so important to remember that businesses are customer oriented.

It's a slow march, but if adoption numbers keep increasing, eventually utility will be great enough for the late adopters to jump on board.

648,q1atvg,Seattleman1955,What are you concerns with Bitcoin?,5,67,"&#x200B;

We all like Bitcoin here, as do I, but what are some of your realistic concerns? Everything has a downside although that's rarely discussed here as much as the upside (of course).

For me it's mainly two concerns, hacking and a concern for the economy that money flowing out of everything else into Bitcoin is potentially reducing growth in the economy since Bitcoin isn't a productive asset.

I also realize that my last concern really may not be a legitimate concern since a vote for Bitcoin is really just a vote against a fiat currency and the way it's being devalued by politicians but when enough people move money from stocks and property to Bitcoin it should have the effect of making the economy less productive.

I've just trying to project into the future a bit and it looks like a world where there is no job growth, more robotics and where assets may be moved from those who produce growth but that don't appreciate at the rate that Bitcoin currently does to Bitcoin and then the economy enters a prolonged recession that effects all assets classes.",2021-10-04 17:53:40

And Coinfloor doing what they just have, not to the same extent obviously, brings back that shitty feeling for having recommended them to my family and friends.

To do things properly, Coinfloor could have:

1. announced with plenty of notice;
1. closed deposits on a date of which customers had had prior notification;
1. closed trading on a date of which customers had had prior notification;
1. asked express permission to pass sensitive data to another jurisdiction that operates under a different financial regulator;
1. at least given people the option of the form (whether BTC or GBP) of withdrawal;
1. ...and in addition to all the above, given plenty of time to do so.

But if he'd done that - and in particular, if only with explicit permissions was this sensitive data handed over to an off-shore third party - if customers had plenty of time and options, the buyer couldn't bank on so many of us transferring and Obi wouldn't have gotten as high a price for a significantly shorter list of transferred customers!

So in that light, of course, closing the exchange at the same time as making the announcement and allowing only either full withdrawal of funds in the form they're in or accepting (and accepting handover of docs to) the new owners makes a narrow if dishonourable sense.

Screw GDPR, screw respect for customer's privacy, screw acknowledging that without these customers, Coinfloor wouldn't have made him the fortune it has, screw integrity.

792,q0f72s,ItsSomethingNot,Coinbase Address Whitelisting Security Concerns,4,29," 

Coinbase has an option to enable address whitelisting. While this sounds a great idea to have an additional layer of security, I do not understand why it works in this ""flawed"" manner.

When I have this option on, and when I add a new address, then there is a period of 48 hours before that new address gets whitelisted. This is not a great way to have ""whitelisting"" feature, as all it does is preventing hacker from stealing bitcoins quickly. In order for me to actually benefit from this function is to check my email every 2 days.

Why Coinbase cannot have this function like other exchanges have, where every new address needs to be approved via email? In my opinion this would be the correct way of ""white listing"" function implementation, what Coinbase is having now is just ""slow address addition"" function - not whitelisting.

427,q2k4we,oldcasiowatch,Moving to the Netherlands,4,6,"Hey everyone. I am a EU citizen. I have been holding BTC for years and plan to move to the Netherlands, where I would like to buy an apartment with it.

My plan is to start off by renting a place, getting the residency paperwork, and opening a bank account. Once this is done, load my BTC onto an exchange, change the BTCs to euros, which I would then transfer to my freshly-opened Dutch bank account. It's with those euros that I would buy the apartment.

If I understand well, I will have no capital gains tax to pay. Is that right? If true, this is a drastic improvement compared to most countries where you have to pay 20% to 30% capital gains tax when you sell your BTC.

I am aware there is a yearly wealth tax in Holland, but that should not be of much concern to me since I will probably have very little BTC left after the apartment purchase, and this would be my main residence, therefore exempt from wealth tax. 

Could someone please confirm that I am not mistaken on anything?

Also, when I cash the BTC, will the Dutch authorities ask for proofs of how I acquired it way back then? (that was 5-6 years ago) It‚Äôs legally acquired BTC, therefore not blacklisted, but I‚Äôm not sure if I keep all the proofs.",2021-10-06 13:09:48

* widespread corruption
* high poverty (at least partially because of inflation), a lot of people are hungry and not able to afford enough food

International help is difficult because transport of goods is limited and it seems even many local humanitarian organizations are full of corruption, not to mention banks and governments grabbing for any money they can.

So here's a little fiction story:  


It's the year 2028 and Bitcoin is now worth a couple of million dollars. Digital scavengers have been digging into eBay and dark web forums to buy encrypted hard drives potentially containing thousands of Bitcoin, and John founded his firm specialized in cracking old HDD for the precious digital gold:  


""They've found the wallet!"" yelled the COO of Cryptographic Solutions to his team. ""The bitcoin is ours!""

The room erupted in cheers as they watched on monitors that showed their computers putting together a puzzle which, when solved, would give them access to what was now estimated at over $300 billion worth of bitcoin.

It had taken years and millions of dollars in hardware investments but finally all their efforts were paying off. As the sound of the celebration died down one employee put her hand up, motioning for attention from her co-workers who seemed eager to return back to work. All they need is to crack the seed phrase they somehow managed to discover the 24 words.  


Will they do it? Is it possible? Is this the new ""Bitcoin mining?

107,q3uoky,kalejsf,Binance -> FTX/Kraken?? Europe,4,4,"
Hello! I am starting to think that I should switch from Binance because I'm scared of all the regulations that are coming for them. At first, I used Kraken for a few months and got pretty used to it, but then wanted to make the switch to Binance because of the lower fees and more available coins. Now with all these regulations I am thinking of switching to a different exchange just in case. Even though both neither FTX and Kraken don't have the altcoins I would own, I feel like I should probably still switch.

FTX as an option:

The fees seem way lower than on any other exchange and they have a few coins I want to hold, but not all of them. The withdrawal fiat fee won't matter to me because I am from Europe and the UI just needs a bit of getting used to. I hate the fact that there aren't many USDT/USDC pairs though

Kraken as an option:

Already got used to it, know what to do and I like the UI a bit better. I've read that they have amazing security, but a lot of ''whicks''too. Fees a bit higher, but I read a post about fees actually being a lot lower than mentioned. 

I had a lot of problems with [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) (customer support, exchange, fees seem high) so I don't want to make them an option (even though I have their ruby steel card) and will use Gemini for those free withdrawals (really doesn't have any coins though).

Is the following possible? 
Is it a good idea? Could it be done differently/ better? 

A Decentralized 
Children‚Äôs Lunch Fund

A tip jar that anyone 
can anonymously 

put as little as 1 penny into and every morning lunch money funds are automatically distributed to wallets 
connected to the system. 

A No kyc , ‚Äúchild safe‚Äù mini wallet with a connected debit card.

Max balance $3 (system keeps it at $3. New funds aren‚Äôt added everyday unless spent)

Like the black card of school lunch. But if it‚Äôs stolen/ or lost, no biggie because it‚Äôs max $3 and carries no sensitive info. 

My son has started kindergarten this year and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about kids like him feeling hungry and it‚Äôs become clear to me through my research that many of the ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù in these spaces are just bloated organizations with CEOS making millions a year while the hunger increases. 

Makes my blood boil. Fuck it 
all man. These things are only concrete in our minds. I want to change this. Seems like I could do a more efficient job feeding kids, by myself, with no money, and just my access to this network ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è. 

I believe in Bitcoin and the lightning network and that it will naturally bring back so much generosity and hope to our lives. 

Price of btc is uninteresting, it will just go up and up, get over it üòú! But what starts to happen to us and our world/systems when the friction between our resources goes away? Eventually I believe/hope our generosity to one another is revealed and expanded in ways we can‚Äôt imagine.

Lets say people do take their money out of Amazon. That would limit amazons ability to expand as rapidly as they are wouldn't it?

&#x200B;

**1.** **Institutional Investments already making a large impact, but have not reached traditional powerhouses** 

  a. None of the top 15 companies on the Forbes 500 list accept or store Bitcoin. 

i. Rumors alone that Walmart/Amazon have looked into purchasing or accepting Bitcoin have ignited recent bull runs.

  b. Tesla will accept Bitcoin once there is confirmation of reasonable clean energy usage by miners.

i. According to Bitcoin Mining Council, Global BTC Mining mix has a 56% Renewable Energy mix as of August 2021. US Mining sitting at 30.5% Renewable Energy mix but improving their mix rapidly.

ii. Tesla‚Äôs reversal set off the last bear run. Tesla accepting will help with retailer perception.

  c. Corporations using Bitcoin as a store of wealth have retained the majority of their investments.  

i. Volatility with buying and selling large scale Crypto quantities creates shareholder doubt. Once approved by BoD, companies historically retain all or most BTC.

  d. Institutional investments decrease the likelihood of Crypto restrictions.

i. Money spent on Lobbying will continue to increase as institutional adoption increases.

ii. Government protects their largest companies. Restrictions would hurt companies who adopt crypto by limiting the customer base domestically and internationally.

&#x200B;

**2.** **Global Adoption increasing while Global FUD is decreasing**

  a. Countries like Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina can allocate earnings to BTC to avoid impact of inflation

i. Already happening in Africa where inflation is regularly one of the highest in the world ‚Äì highest adoption rate globally.

  b. Global P2P transfer removes remittance costs 

i. Nayib Bukele listed this a primary reason for Bitcoin as legal Tender and Jack Mallers showed the ease recently by transferring through Twitter

  c. China FUD disappearing after complete ban. India reversed course with earlier rumors of banning Crypto.

&#x200B;

**3.** **Bitcoin has established itself as the primary store of value Cryptocurrency**

  a. Bitcoin is the primary Store of Value cryptocurrency due to its market dominance, security, and first-to-market ownership.

i. Institutional and Global adoption have secured BTC as the primary store of value option. 

ii. Cap of 21MM with already 18.8MM mined. Halvening every 4 years limits new supply to the market making BTC more appealing to institutional investors

iii. Lightning and Taproot integration increase security and scalability.

  b. Utilitarian Cryptocurrency value is dictated by its functionality. 

i. New projects are coming out daily which improve on existing technology. This creates a need for a store of value to transfer between upcoming technologies.",2021-10-06 16:49:31

&#x200B;

Thise has been a question that I have been struggling with over the last few weeks of study..

**What is the value of a blockchain outside of an application for money?**

Ammous' position on this in the Bitcoin Standard is that there is really no use for a blockchain outside of the context of creating hard money and digital scarcity. Parker Lewis echoes that perspective. Lewis draws the point out a bit more by explaining that: a blockchain is only useful within the application of money because without the native money there is no security and without security the value and integrity of the currency breaks down. The ""line"" on this among most bitcoiners generally also seems to be that blockchain technology serves no purpose in other applications...If blockchain removes the need for a trusted third party, are there NO other applications where this can be useful?

&#x200B;

Does a blockchain not make sense and work in the context of NFTs? For example, the idea of authenticating unique digital property and removing the need to trust a third party seems to make some sense. Or in decentralized social media platforms? Where the censorship resistant nature could be desirable feature.

Also, I am talking about permisionless blockchains and not permissioned ones as the latter seems to sort of defeat the purpose of a decentralized blockchain to begin with.

Struggling with this a bit and curious to hear perspectives... thanks",2021-10-02 11:34:17

Edit: Thanks for all the help. For anyone interested in doing similar, my experience as someone with minimal Lightning Experience was this:

Set up Zap. Managed to fund it on chain but failed to open any channels. Received a tip from the lntip bot here and was able to pass it straight on to another user, which made me realise that I was making a meal of it. Installed Muun, transferred on-chain from Zap.

Just clicked on the bot's 'Deposit' link, which launches a private message dialogue with default amount set. I guess that will then send me an invoice I can paste into Muun...

Edit 2: Oooh, that's nice. I just experienced the future! So now I can tip to my heart's content here on Reddit, which was the main purpose of this. I will tackle Twitter another day. Or maybe not at all.

156,q3mfv7,AdaZhang1987,BTC,2,2,"I once imagined that the process of Bitcoin ""occupying"" the world is likely to be a process of ""small countries encircling large countries"":

Big countries do not need cryptocurrency. They have the ability to control currency issuance, stabilize prices, and fight against the currencies of other big countries.

Some small countries, such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela, have insufficient national power and limited government capabilities to control prices. In fact, most countries in South America and Africa are facing this problem, but to a different degree. Some of these countries‚Äô monetary systems have long since collapsed, and they can only watch the people abandon their national currencies and switch to the US dollar.

This is tantamount to handing over the country's financial power to the United States: during the epidemic, the United States printed $3 trillion in three months, which is equivalent to directly plundering more than 10% of its wealth.

El Salvador is a living example: in 2001, due to the vicious depreciation of the original legal currency, the krona, El Salvador decided to adopt the US dollar as the official currency. Currently, 90% of the circulating currency in the market is US dollars, and the krona is in a state of being completely abandoned.

Think about everything in an empathy. From the standpoint of a country like El Salvador, what would you do? What can you do? QJ by the United States, or by other countries? Or choose a currency that does not belong to any country, and no one can cheat, and get rid of the control of a big country?

Of course, judging from the current situation, the use of Bitcoin cannot completely get rid of the influence of big countries, but at least it will not be left to the mercy of one big country. After all, Bitcoin is not the United States in the final say.

Many people say that the price of Bitcoin is unstable and that it is not reliable to use it as a national legal tender. Do you really know how volatile the currencies of these small countries are? Argentina's inflation rate in 2019 was 53.8%, Zimbabwe was 521%, and Venezuela was 340,000%! In contrast, Bitcoin is simply too gentle and bullish for the long term.

Therefore, for many small countries, it is not only completely possible to use Bitcoin as legal tender, but it is even the best solution under the current situation.

Although El Salvador is small, from 0 to 1 is of great significance. From then on, more small countries will discover the benefits of doing so, and achieve from 1 to N. When more and more countries recognize cryptocurrency, it will always affect larger countries, which is the same as ""rural surrounding cities"".

What's more, people are really not a small country!

The Republic of El Salvador is the most densely populated country in Central America, with an area of ‚Äã‚Äã20,720 square kilometers, 14 provinces, and a total population of 6.705 million.

In terms of population ranking, El Salvador ranks 109th out of 233 countries and regions in the world, surpassing Singapore, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and New Zealand. How can it be considered a middle level?

My question is inspired by a thread from yesterday:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q2d5qm/think\_somebody\_can\_guess\_or\_accidentally\_get\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q2d5qm/think_somebody_can_guess_or_accidentally_get_your/)

So the question is as follows.

With the list of bip 39 [https://coldbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bip-39-wordlist.pdf](https://coldbit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/bip-39-wordlist.pdf)

can one create their own set of seed words (say 11 out of 12, with the latest one being the checksum word) in a certain alphabetic order of the first letters of each word? In such case one would only need to remember one word (11 lettered) or set of letters in order to reproduce 11 words with the entire mnemonic being exposed in random order?

&#x200B;

For Example:

*I Love Bitcoin And Would Like To Hodl It Forever Lol*

That's

**I L B A W L T H I F L**

Each individual letter corresponds to a seed word from the list, like:

*Inch Loop Beef Abuse West Lizard Total Hampster Indoor Famous Leopard*

These words can be stored in exposed matter in random order and all the holder needs to remember is the passphrase to reconstruct the proper order of the mnemonic (which is *I Love Bitcoin And Would Like To Hodl It Forever Lol)*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Another example.

Here's your randomly generated BIP39 mnemonic

*grant like cotton ladder affair glad element hire cave walnut another advance*

&#x200B;

You last word is the checksum so let's disregard it.

Take the first letters of the mnemonic in the proper order:

**G L C L A G E H C W A**

&#x200B;

You phrase that can help to reconstruct the mnemonic could be something like:

*Glen Loves Colored Lollipops After Getting Extremely High Catching Weed Ants*

So theoretically, you can shuffle the seed words as you wish and keep them anywhere exposed. You would have to remember this phrase to be able to regenerate the proper order.

That is aside from keeping your mnemonic protected in the regular ways.

&#x200B;

I've been a hodler and buyer since early 2017, and want to realise some profits during this bull run (I expect 240k per coin in December/January). I'm a dolfin hodler - not much, but all my income except expenses went to btc during the last years.

But being a tax resident in EU is not an easy thing: if I sell my btc as a person, I'll get 40%+ tax on the whole transaction (i bought it for peanuts). At the same time, I enjoy zero tax on dividends, as a non-domiciled resident. That's why all my coins I own were purchased from my personal company account: the idea was to pay only the corp tax, that is half of personal income tax, and distribute myself some cheesy dividends at zero rate.

Now, when I think that I'm going to pay 4-5 mil as taxes I cannot sit. You know.

So, my question is, what tax residency for another company can you recommend together with the bank that is really friendly, to cash out my coins? I was looking at dubai freezone ltds, but have no idea what is the position of bankers about crypto there.

It's not few thousands, I cannot do it with atm, and I need the income to be declared (at least as dividends with 0%).

After the news came out, the market stored easing policy expectations, sentiment positive under the short term rise in bitcoin.

&#x200B;

In addition U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase also provided a comprehensive overview of some of the key reasons behind bitcoin's recent rally. JPMorgan noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, which is considered to be the main factor behind the recent price spike. It should be noted that after the news that the Development and Reform Commission and the Central Bank issued a series of notices to regulate mining and virtual currency trading speculation, the market speculation faded and the crypto market as a whole sank.

&#x200B;

However, experts in the crypto field are more worried about the regulation in the U.S. than in China, and Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, pointed out in an interview that the bigger risk is that U.S. regulators follow China's example. And at the same time, U.S. regulators have stepped up their focus on the crypto sector. Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has been calling for regulation of the crypto market, and the SEC has been working overtime to develop a set of rules to do just that. Others, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have also expressed concern about the space.

&#x200B;

And with Powell making it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, crypto market concerns have seen a huge upturn. In addition, Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also said that his agency has neither the authority nor the intention to ban digital assets during the hearing.

&#x200B;

Notably, JPMorgan also believes that the rapid adoption of lightning networks has also driven the rally. Largely due to El Salvador and Twitter, this has led to a significant increase in the adoption of the Tier 2 payments track.

&#x200B;

Previous news shows that Twitter has integrated Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, enabling Bitcoin tipping payments for iOS users. The tip feature will rely entirely on third-party payment services, such as the Strike app, and the latest news on October 8 shows that Twitter's ""Tip"" feature is now available to all IOS users, who can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page. Users can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page (the default status is ""off"") to activate it.

&#x200B;

In addition, news on October 7 revealed that Open Bank Project, API3, Qredo & Sovryn and Banco Hipotecario have formed an alliance to facilitate the process of bitcoinization in El Salvador.

&#x200B;

Finally, investors' concerns about inflation have resurfaced. gold stabilized on Oct. 4 news as the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly, with higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data and strong manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, bitcoin is gradually replacing gold as a hedge against inflation, reigniting interest in using bitcoin as an inflation hedge. galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz also predicts that bitcoin's market cap will surpass that of gold within a few years. 

&#x200B;

Notably, the latest news shows that the SEC has approved the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Technology ETF, which gives investors easy access to companies that hold large amounts of bitcoin.

&#x200B;

In addition,, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently predicted that bitcoin will rise again by the end of 2021. He claims that the horse that turns near the finish line tends to win. So near the end of the year, the great asset classes, the best performing asset classes usually have a great finish.",2021-10-08 05:24:43

I started to avoid doing any of it, or hoping for it to help tp predict anything..I read articles and try to read any news related to crypto ( negative or positive ) and make assumptions that Bitcoin will go up or down, and I feel like it is going up for the moment and it won't stop, more adoption higher price, simple is that..

But the TA is a good tool that can make you think you can predict something and a good tool also that give you easily excuses that justifies why your something hasn't been achieved, just draw more lines, move one a little bit and here you are, that's why the resistance is 54 not 53 :) and Wouaah.. wth !

TA isn't testable, I see a lot of guys ( claiming experts ) who just says thing like bitcoin will reach 53, if it breaks up then it goes to 60 ( 70% ), if not then it will return to 48 ( 30 % ), so what they do exactly if they give you the only two choices available ( it may go up or down ), how can this help ? aand those numbers are meaningless ( 70% & 30% ) for many reasons

\- If BTC go up, the ""expert"" will be like "" OKAY, I told you, see ? "", if not ""OKAY, that wasn't expected, but i told you it may go down too "", like eseriously ? how would I take such person as a reference ?

\- Those numbers ( 70% - 30% ) are exactly the same as ( 65% - 35% ) or ( 50% - 50% ) , a number that shows that you're positive or negative that's all, those numbers aren't based on anything, in a scientific field, a scientist or statistics guy can give you such numbers and he'll show you how many scenarios has been tested and repeated to get those numbers, in Crytpo charts, this isn't the case at all, because every scenario isn't the same as before, every scenario is a different case, so you can't test it ?

\- I like when a TA guy start giving you prices a crypto may stop up or get tested at, and he start drawing his shitlines based on previous tops or bottoms, and give you prices like 23, 27, 33, and then a major event comes in and the coin drops to 3 or jumps to 40, he becomes just so ridiculous ? or the price for example goes to 25.5 and start getting tested and then again starts drawing new lines to justify why this is the new restiance or support or whataver LOL

A lite node keeps only the hashed headers of blocks and not a complete record of every transaction. Is this correct? Do lite nodes keep a complete history of every block header or do they also only store a certain amount?

I understand that the benefit of this is that less data has to be stored. What is the downside, if any? 

Do miners have to be full nodes?

I've been cleaning out the house and selling things on Craigslist, OfferUp, etc. There's an option on Craigslist now that says ""accept crypto"". I really want to get in on this, but am unsure of the smartest way to go about it. How are others going about doing their private sales? Questions:

1. This might be a stupid question, but how do you determine an acceptable crypto price? In a volatile world, do you do a conversion on the day of the sale and figure out the acceptable fiat equivalent? Is this the normal, accepted practice?
2. How do you actually do the transfer? Do you give them your wallet address, have them do the transfer in front of you, then wait the required amount of time for it to show up in your account before you let them have the merchandise? I know some coins are faster than others. I've waited for a transfer from one of my wallets to another (I forget which coin) for a few hours once.
3. Do you typically only accept certain types of crypto, say only BTC?
4. Do you give them your cold-storage wallet address to receive the funds? I think there's a concern that they can see your total holdings that way. So do you give them an address on an exchange instead?

Any tips are appreciated. I definitely want to start getting into the world of *using* crypto instead of just buying and hodling (not that there's anything wrong with that. I just want to contribute to the active application of crypto in practical uses.)",2021-10-01 18:11:15

And that no matter how good and beneficial the technology behind bitcoin is, and that more and more people are buying in, the bitcoin market would still be ran by whale wallets, which are always at the mercy of the goverment.

Another point he made was that many whale wallets right now in the market are government people money, and they use bitcoin as means of laundering. As the needs to launder money go down, bitcoin will also loses its value.

> Under an inflationary regime, miners mostly play nice with each other. Although fees vary a little, any transaction submitted to the network is about the same as any other, so miners mostly ignore the specifics of transactions and just focus on mining blocks. That may not be the case in an all-fee regime. When fees are everything, the very notion of consensus begins to fray. Recall that at any time, there are as many different versions of the blockchain in existence as there are miners working on it, and it is only by announcing the discovery of a new block that a miner causes all other miners to abandon their chains and begin mining on top of the new, longest chain (technically ‚Äúheaviest‚Äù chain, but whatever). **Now consider a miner who has just found out that he is working on the second longest chain. Rather than abandon it for the longer chain, he can leave some high fee transactions up for grabs in the transaction queue as inducement to other miners to come work on his chain. Consensus is fractured, hashpower is fragmented across competing versions of the chain, the security budget falls, and throughput suffers.** I am far from competent to speak on the general class of consensus attacks possible under a fee regime, but it is worth noting that there are attacks hypothesized to be possible with far less than 51% hashpower, possibly even less than 10%.",2021-10-03 13:39:27

It would make transactions cheaper for users (no need to include transaction fee) but users would still be able to include a fee of their choice to support the network/miners. And I reckon many still would, it would be like your donation to Bitcoin but better.

906,pzi85n,Athomas1,Bitcoin wastes electricity,0,69,"There is no single solution to the climate crisis.

I think that having a market based mechanism forcing electricity producers to compete is really important. We've tried increasing the cost of electricity through carbon credits, and seen some success. Ive been working through the idea of bitcoin as a mechanism for restricting investment into electricity production by providing a global price-floor for electricity.

ill need to assume a few things to explain it:

1. Mining bitcoin is a waste of electricity
2. Bitcoin is bought and sold for a price
3. Bitcoin production does not require massive infrastructure, just computers a satellite and some electricity

(A)If  bitcoin wastes electricity and people buy that electricity, they are  effectively saying ""electricity production and consumption is worth at  least X"". Where X is the price of bitcoin.True:  As long as 1 & 2 of  our assumption are true.

(B)Coal  plants, gas refineries, or water dams, produce electricity, they can  look at bitcoin and say 'we will at least get X for producing  electricity' where X is the profit from mining bitcoin minus the cost of  building infrastructure to mine bitcoin. If 3 is true then the cost and time required to produce bitcoin is small compared to other economic activities.

True: As long as 3 is true, every electricity provider in the world now has a minimum price-floor for electricity production.

(C)The  conclusion is that companies or countries across the world will mine bitcoin if you accept the above facts. The same factors now apply to  previously distant/remote electricity production, that could not be consumed by people, including volcanoes.

True: As long as you accepted (A) and (B) then the above holds.

If  (C) is true, any investment in electricity production must now compete on a global scale. Meaning the cheapest electricity production and therefore the most profitable, will receive investment and the alternatives such as coal factories, water dams, or potentially solar panels will have their access restricted.

Its no longer just your local market asking 'is this electricity production going to be cheaper than this other production' its the entire global market using volcanoes, and wind in the middle of the sea, and other shit, to say 'no'.

p.s. This is an idea that i've been trying to work through but I feel there are some pretty big implications from bitcoin and how it will effect previously 'national'/local electricity markets by forcing them to compete on a global scale.  


Edit: Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

**These were of great interest to people and even ""peeled"" Casascius coins are collector's items. All I am suggesting is that a government like that of El Salvador might mint these -- the Casascius guy was legally prevented from continuing. I think El Salvador could make coins that end up being very popular numismatically -- I sure would be interested.**

EDIT: One issue I guess was counterfeits -- if the coin had a public address that was funded but the hologram protected a bogus private key, you would never find out unless you peeled it. I don't know how many counterfeits were made. But this is the same problem that all collectibles have -- you have to watch out for counterfeits. For really valuable (numismatically) coins, a serious counterfeiter would never fool around with shorting you on the gold content. They would actually attempt to alter a less valuable coin.

With Bitcoin being so high-priced now, I am not sure how to protect oneself from counterfeiting -- when these coins were first minted, even 1000 btc was no big deal but I assume having a 1000 btc unpeeled coin you would have trouble finding a buyer -- even at a discount and you would end up peeling it yourself. What I see on ebay are primarily peeled coins -- not sure I saw any unpeeled.

So I wonder what the selling price today of an unpeeled 1 btc coin is?

Right?

I would love to own an El Salvador million Satoshi coin. It could have volcano on one side.

Seriously, is minting bitcoin physical coins going to resume?

EDIT: To be clear: There used to be a guy who was minting physical coins (up to 1000 BTC -- such a coin you can now buy a very nice condo in Manhattan with and still be able to buy a jet) with a tamper evident hologram. If you wanted to buy one, you would verify the address contained the promised BTC. Then they made the guy stop minting them -- he lived in USA.

El Salvador could resume making such coins, in much smaller denominations, perhaps as commemoratives  which would sell at a premium. The only concern, which no one seemed to have when the guy was minting them, was that he retained the private keys but as soon as anyone could show that his public address was emptied while his hologram was intact, no one would buy any more of the coins and the guy afaik was not running a scam.

Anyway, I would love to own such a commemorative coin which would have a value of around 500 bucks today but would maybe sell for 10% premium. Maybe the 1 million satoshi could be made of silver and the five million made of gold, alloy worth 2500 bucks plus maybe 500 bucks for the gold.",2021-10-01 19:27:40

935,pzd9pb,Richieman77,Satcent proposal. Better alternative to Satcomma standard?,0,4,"Hi everybody,

I've come across the Satcomma standard and similar proposals recently. I immediately came up with an alternative that seems easier and simpler to me. Surprisingly I haven't seen anyone else come up with this. I'm just throwing the idea out here, hopefully someone finds it useful.

&#x200B;

So Satcomma represents an amout of BTC as follows: ‚Çø6.15,395,023

I understand, you understand, but it will be confusing to the majority of the population. Guaranteed.

&#x200B;

Here is my Satcent proposal.

Let's redefine Sats as follows:

* 1.000.000 SATS = 1 BTC 
* A sat can have 2 decimal places, Satcents.

So 1 BTC = 1.000.000,00 SATS

So if you are SAT millionair you have 1 BTC and a sat can be devided into 100 Satcents.

Most major currencies use cents, and a millionaire is already a well established concept. It makes totally sense to me. What do you think?

Very simple and recognizable for everybody.

Just my 2 SAT cents worth.

&#x200B;

\- In 2012/13, I saw a reddit post that led me to buy one bitcoin, and I believe I spent around \~$100

&#x200B;

\- Thinking on time frames and Reddit trending post potentials, Alexis Ohanian had invested in Coinbase while he was apart of Initialized (or maybe he was apart of YC and helping Coinbase founders); but short is Reddit had a likely interest to help spread crypto.  So if it hit r/all I probably saw it. Also a fair assumption when looking at his [recent post on web3](https://twitter.com/alexisohanian/status/1442899050164998148?s=20) and pumping it on Reddit.  Since I know I was at work too, the post I would have seen would have been during the week (M - F).

&#x200B;

\- I have looked through saved post on my reddit accounts to see if I had saved the original reddit post  (I didn't).  Basically I've done all the generic level searching I can (old computers, hard drives, emails, notes, etc).  Doesn't mean I'm not searching right though.

&#x200B;

\- Pretty sure I bought it on an old work computer but would have saved information elsewhere.

&#x200B;

\- Guessing too I would have bought it on hardware wallet based on what I think I would have done/known back then

&#x200B;

\- An assumption, but I think I put whatever information I had from that work computer likely in a note or word doc on my home computer. **Good news there, I still have that computer.** I've got it up and even have the old hard drives I routinely backed everything up on. It's an old toshiba laptop from about 2007 with windows, but I haven't found anything there yet

&#x200B;

This part is irrelevant now, but just frustrating:

So I used to have this purple notecard in this lockbox I've had for a while, and on the card it had a lot of random digits.  It was in a zip locked bag and only until recently I realized/thought of this. I also remember thinking wtf is this in my saved box of a minimal amount of stuff, but for years I saved it.

For some reason a couple years back I threw it out.  No idea why.

280,q345xr,-Scott_Trenti,October 7: BTC is expected to reach a high level and will continue to rise during the day.,0,5,"BTC contract analysis: Yesterday, the daily line of BTC continued to close in the sun continuously, and the price was as high as expected. However, the sideways correction of the Asia-Europe plate is still time for space, and there is no chance of a big retracement such as long-term. If the price is to go out of the extremely high level, first, the sideways position; Second: 618 position of retreat, which is the explosion point of reference rise. Yesterday, relying on more than 50700-50600 areas, we also successfully reached the target area of 52500 for harvesting.

For the short-term trading of BTC contract in the day, the daily line rose sharply, breaking the high close in the early morning. Although the daily index has entered the overbought area, it is still necessary to consider the risk of retracement after the emergence of top deviation. Therefore, today's thinking is still more, saying that the short-term trading position of BTC contract in the next day, in the strong closing market, only the revised low point and position 618 in the early morning are considered, while the revised low point in the early morning is near the 54500 area and the position 618 is near the 53700 area, which are all positions with more reference layout arrangements today. It is more radical to have more light positions in the 54500 area, and it is only necessary to add positions to the normal position in the 53700 area. The target is to look at the vicinity of the 56500 area.

274,q34zvw,sikeig,The Problems that slow down mainstream adoption of Bitcoin (In my Opinion),0,11,"#**Fraction Buying**

The majority of the population still isn‚Äôt even aware that neo-broker offer buying fractions of a stock. ‚Äî Not a single person that I know outside of the crypto market knew that you can buy a fraction of a Bitcoin.

- People aren‚Äôt aware of fraction buying; they consider Bitcoin ‚Äú*too expensive*‚Äù (they think they can‚Äôt afford it)

- If they plan to invest in the crypto market, other coin prices seem more attractive since they don‚Äôt understand market capitalization

And I don‚Äôt think the transition from BTC -> Sats as a metric makes anything more simple for the average user.

#**Fool Proof**

Well I think Bitcoin isn‚Äôt **‚Äúfool proof‚Äù**. Maintaining your own private keys on a non-custodial wallet is quite a challenge for the average user.

- Maintaining security on a day to day basis with software/hot wallets

- No central entity, No 2FA, No password reset options etc.

This will obviously lead to custodial wallets and centralized software/exchange solutions. More centralization of services and coins.

#**Transaction Fees**

Well I don‚Äôt want to fuel the block size conflict and proposal of hardforks but base layer transactions aren‚Äôt competitive at all. Free online banking transactions are simply the norm.

I don‚Äôt really like the Lightning Network and the idea of having your Sats sitting off chain in a channel.

#**Price Fluctuations**

Since Bitcoin shifted from a P2P cash sytem to a ‚Äústore of value‚Äù asset, most of the holders are only interested in acquiring more fiat funds.

- Mostly over-leveraged positions are the reason for the drastic price changes

- Binance, FTX, Bitfinex etc. are still trading against their own customer positions without any regulation",2021-10-07 09:02:03

I have founded a wallet on my mobile phone a few years ago. The app is called **Ethos**. The wallet is universal. There is a separate address for BTC, ETH etc. The issue is that the wallet has only **one 24-seed** which should recover all the ""daughter"" wallets.

I decided to transfer my BTC (in my case the wallet includes only BTC, not other altcoins) to Binance. I logged into the wallet and surprisingly was not able to send the amount without a PIN code. The issue is that there was not any PIN code before. In order to create a PIN code the users have to insert the **24 word seed phrase**. I have found a list with my seed words. The issue is that I have writted down only **23 words**.

&#x200B;

I have found this app:

[https://github.com/ZenGo-X/mnemonic-recovery](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/mnemonic-recovery)

The app should be able to generate **possible missing words and existing addresses** when I write the 23 words and a questionmark on 1st, 2nd, 3rd.... 24th place. It has generated approximately 200 possible solutions. approx 8 words for every place. The issue is that none of the addresses generated next to the missing words is my ""daughter"" BTC address.

&#x200B;

I guess the Ethos wallet has  a special ""parent"" address for the ""daughter"" wallets.

Should I try all approx. 200 possible solutions from the app above? I can clearly see that none of the 200 possible addresses is actually my ""daughter"" BTC address. Is it possible that there are some other possible words for a ""parent"" address?

I'd like to hear people's thoughts on the problem of insurance. I do not currently believe bitcoin can become the main currency in wealthy countries without good insurance options. Sure, banks and insurance companies are crooks but that doesn't mean there isn't major value to having insurance for the security of your assets. I fully support the freeing of power from their control. But I don't think most people will ever feel comfortable having their life savings sitting in a relatively easily stolen or lost format without insurance, in their custody. That is not realistic. It sounds pretty damn easy to snap a photo of a seed phrase and then drain a wallet at a later date without any consequences. I would guess most people continue to hold home-owner's insurance after their mortgage is paid off because the risk of losing everything in a fire far outweighs the yearly premium.

So far neither Chivo nor Bukele have addressed the issue, it is also believed that there are hundreds of thousands of support cases opened in less than a month.

I mean, there must be many ways of achieving this, but some of them might create window to a possible attack, something that doesn't endanger your coins while you are alive, and only when you are gone they are allowed to get them.

I think some services that have your wallet must offer this way of designing someone in events like this, I have this option in my app but it is from stocks. However there must be users who don't want to rely on having their credentials/wallet guarded by a third party that might get hacked.

My guess is something like physically carving in something of metal the safe words then putting that in a box and stored in a safe from a bank that has some arrangement to not allow anyone except you, but when you die a family member can gain access only then?. Also don't know how expensive they are, but in case they are not, maybe splitting the safe words in multiple banks or something?.

Any ideas? I am just curious (I don't have this problem but maybe one day, if I decide to invest in crypto this is one concern I would have).

Breaking the bottom is definitely impossible at present, and there is no signal of breaking the bottom at present in terms of the rebound amplitude and form. Of course, the bullish sentiment should not be too high. After all, the previous callback is still not small, so it is enough to continue the shock of the current structure. The market outlook is not clear, so take it one step at a time.

On the short-term side, the BTC contract in the day surged and fell back yesterday, which means that the strength in the back still needs to be matched by the form. On the short-term side, it oscillates or bottomed out. Operation strategy: the top touches the first empty space in the 48900 area, and the top breaks the 49300 area to retreat and adjust the warehouse. The target is the 47900-47700 area, and the bottom pays attention to the 47300-47200 areas and the 47000-46900 areas.

We suggest that there are many areas in 47,300-47,200 and 47,000-46,900, and harvest in the final target of 48,900 in the evening. The daily line bottomed out and turned up. In the short term, it is still a signal of more shocks. Therefore, today's thinking is also very simple, and the main rise is the best policy.

In the short-term view of the BTC contract in the day, it has risen and fallen yesterday, which means that the future strength still needs to cooperate with it. In the short-term day, it is justified or the bottom will be reviewed. Operation strategy: the upper reaches the 48900 area and the 49300 area is first empty and the position will be withdrawn. The target is 47900-47700, the bottom is concerned about the 47300-47200 area to open long, and the target is to look at the 48400-48900 area. (Note that shorting must be short first, bottoming out and giving up shorts, there is no limit for longs

For short-term trading of BTC contracts during the day, the daily line broke the previous day's high, and it basically closed at yesterday's high in the early morning. If you are long, you cannot wait for a large retracement. In today's operation, you need to be aggressive to intervene in arrangements. , Focus on the continuity after Boyang line, short-term trading strategy of BTC contract: retrace the 48700-48600 area first to light up the position, go to the 48400 area and then cover the position to the normal position. The target is near the 50,000 area.

To preface, I am not an evangelist of Bitcoin nor any other chain. I am interested in learning about different blockchain architectures. This question is genuinely something I am curious about and I would love to understand the community's thoughts on this. 

Question: Why are there no bridges between the Lightning Network and other chains such as Eth/Sol/Terra etc?? 

I ask because the blockchain world is becoming inherently multichain. Solana is connecting to Ethereum. Ethereum projects are launching on Avalanche and so on. Each chain is trying to develop unique projects and inviting other altcoins and communities to engage. This will have a net/net benefit for both chains surrounding exposure and ease of use. Why does LN not have bridges to these worlds to either send or recieve Bitcoin and compatible altcoins. 

From my understanding, the main use cases of LN are 1) global settlement and finality of cash with no fees 2) creation of feeless micropayments.  However unlike other chains, the LN doesn't have robust Smart contract support, correct?  


If so, why not create a bridge between Bitcoin and Avalance for instance to give current LN users exposed to defi and NFT based projects without ever leaving the application?   


Back to the example, if two LN users send funds to each other, why can't they both earn additional yield on their funds sitting on LN? From a user perspective, not only do I get global cash finality but also yield opportunities on that cash. This is huge :)   


The LN community benefits from this integration as now these users/customers have yield generation/borrowing and lending protocols at their disposal. While other chains benefit due to LN instant finality for sending funds and the ability to connect to a major user base.   


Thanks everyone and would love to hear your genuine opinions on whether creating a bridge beween LN and other chains is a good or bad idea :)",2021-10-03 23:04:05

I acknowledge BTC as revolutionary genius invention and I'm sure blockchain will change our world to  better. But legal tender?

Inflationary monetary policy discourages money hoarding and encourages spending and more importantly investments. BTC is deflationary and therefore encourages its hoarding.

Now what happens if spending/investment is discouraged by adopting BTC as legal tender? No investments by companies means not improving efficiency of the production process and its technology. No progression to automation in production means people will be stuck with their boring monotonous job instead of learning something new or be released from salary slavery altogether (universal income when automation is ubiquitous and taxed for example). What I see future hold for these countries is factories falling apart producing the same things for decades. No technology improvements at all. Salary slavery never ending.

One plus would be people being able to save money and maybe retire at some point. And probably products made to last which would benefit our planet. Remittances cheaper of course. All these good effects could be attained and better by issuing CBDC on a public blockchain. You could issue deflationary currency for the people and inflationary for businesses for example (or currency with expiration). Or build in incentives for sustainability... Many other things which would benefit everybody and the planet. CBDCs would of course require very good privacy provisions otherwise it would unleash horrible Orwellian dystopia.

I am by no means expert on monetary policy and I have no formal econ education, but this LEGAL TENDER thing seems to be quite scary, don't you think?

407,q2m43w,ChrimsonChin988,Buying and HODLing BTC based only on market sentiment (Chads only),0,3,"https://preview.redd.it/b9qz2apoeur71.png?width=1130&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a0729af676dbbf652b0b1aeb9ffdcb18ff2adfe

The top graph (Feb 2018 is as far as it went back) is based on 'market sentiment', meaning: sentiment is high when prices are volatile, high trading volumes, alt coins are making big moves (Bitcoin dominance is low), lots of news coverage etc. When sentiment is high(>75%) you don't do shit. You don't sell, you don't buy, you HODL. You just sit on your giant balls of steel.

On the other hand, when sentiment is low(<30%) you better have saved up a FAT stack of cash (because you were not FOMOing when market sentiment was high) and you BUY.

The other graph is BTC price in USD.

&#x200B;

This method might seem crude/simple and that's because IT IS this simple.

I see a lot of Technical Analysis posts/video's and granted although sometimes a good argument is made, lots of mediocre/borderline shitty advice is given as well. My main issue with a lot of TA is that it doesn't take classic investor traps into account (fear/greed) and is often based on hindsight.

Investing is, for a large part, not 'big brain' stuff.

Just take a look at the macro strategy of Buffett for example: when sentiment is high, he just waits and when prices inevitably adjust (market sentiment declines) he has saved up a lot of $ and buys at a good price.

This is, very simply said, what this old fart has done for 75 yrs (Patience + logic instead of fear/greed).

It's about having your emotions (greed/fear) under control and having a long-term mindset. Stoicism comes to mind.

Granted these graphs are kinda scuffed & lacking detail, that's 1)Because I want even the thickest of heads to get this and 2)it isn't necessary because of how simple this really is.

&#x200B;

These graphs demonstrate my point wonderfully:

When sentiment is low: buy

When sentiment is high: patience.

&#x200B;

What inevitable happens when you try to both buy low & sell high is that you end up selling right at the beginning of a giant bull run (in this case December 2020) and you miss out on the fattest gains.

If, like me, you plan on keeping your BTC for at least another 10 yrs because you believe it's one, if not the, best performing asset at the moment; you don't sell and you buy more when market sentiment is low. (Notice I don't say when prices are low. A 'low' price is relative, 10k per BTC seems cheap now but it wasn't 2 years ago. In contrast, a market sentiment of 25 was low 2 years ago and it's low now.)

Understand that your mind is trying to sabotage your success. People that try to buy low & sell high usually end up doing the exact opposite because of fear/greed.

That's why you don't play that game. You buy and you wait. Then you buy some more and wait some more. 

This also gives you great peace of mind because you are not trying to 'time the market'. You don't plan on selling any, hence you don't care when prices are going up/down/sideways. 

Just occasionally check to see if market sentiment is low, in which case you buy. 

&#x200B;

This approach requires a different mindset and it takes some getting used to but trust me the mental peace & long-term gains are very worth it.

&#x200B;

Another suggestion: 

This approach is also great in combination with cost averaging. 

Meaning: every month you have $500 to put into BTC. Instead of putting all $500 in, you put in $250 regardless of market sentiment

and save the other $250 for when market sentiment is very low. By the time market sentiment drops below 30% you have saved up say $1500 and buy a large chunk in one go.

This approach is great because it offers additional protection against your FOMOing mind that would otherwise go crazy when prices are rising and you're not buying anything making it seems as if you are losing out on a lot of gains. In addition, when prices inevitably go down again, you have saved up some funds to buy at a good price.",2021-10-06 14:54:33

384,q2nwyo,oneoldfarmer,Volatility as an obstacle to adoption for transactions,0,3,"This week I made a large purchase and was pleasantly surprised when paying by bitcoin was a checkout option.  The transaction went smoothly and after the purchase I immediately exchanged some fiat to replace my spent btc, but this was my first time experiencing volatility fear.  There has been a lot of price movement over the past week which amplified my fear.

What if BTC price goes up and I effectively overpaid for my thing?What if BTC price goes down and the vendor tells me that I haven't sufficiently paid my bill (which was denominated in $$)?

This gave me a good chance to think about the issue and here's what I've got so far:BTC price volatility only matters during the time window between my spending of BTC and my replacing with new BTC.  If I were to use BTC for all transactions then I would probably replace (or DCA buy BTC) daily.  It also matters to the vendor during the time window between when they accepted the purchase and when they convert to fiat (if they feel inclined to do something foolish like that) which could also happen daily.  This leads me to believe that the weekly price swings don't matter; really only the price swings over the course of a business day matter.

One more factor.  The default payment option was paypal which would have charged a 3% fee as opposed to my on chain fee of less than 0.05%.  Let's pretend in a perfect world the 3% savings was split evenly between me and the vendor.  That discount gives me and the vendor each a 1.5% buffer to cover volatility.

My conclusion:Once BTC/$ exchange rate smoothes out to a point where the normal price swing is less than 1.5% per day then BTC can be safely used (without my silly fears) for every transaction.  We're not there yet, but I predict that this smoothing of volatility will come with increased adoption and volume, and now I have a metric to judge how close we are to ""smooth enough"".

I am taking the same approach towards bitcoin.

I am looking at all the arguments, and counter arguments.

Will this just make one confused? I am a computer science major, so I understand what bitcoin is about and I find it interesting on a computer science level, but when it comes to economics, politics, I know not too much about that stuff, but since I am invested into bitcoin already I might as well take the dive and educate myself.",2021-10-06 03:53:39
460,q2d2tz,XXsforEyes,BTC ETF Futures Pump & Infrastructure Bill Dip,0,1,"So‚Ä¶ the 3.5 Trillion dollar infrastructure bill has some unfriendly crypto language in it (like a vague definition of what a broker is) and the vote for it has been pushed back until October 31st. When it passes, assuming it does probably without the language being changed, the market could see a dip. Meanwhile, the SEC has delayed their decision on BTC Futures ETFs 45 days until well into November. An announcement from the SEC could come sooner, and this would likely cause a pump. What do you think about the possibility of a sweet spot after the infrastructure vote and before the SEC announcement?  Could we see a sell-off? How much do you think it could be?",2021-10-06 04:29:40

I'm worried GBTC in an IRA will have worse returns than buying BTC on an exchange, even after considering long term capital gains taxes.
